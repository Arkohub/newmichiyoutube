 We will now study what happens when  we merge independent Poisson processes.  The story as well as the final conclusion  is going to be similar to what happened for the case  where we merged independent Bernoulli processes.  In particular, we will see that the merged process will also  be Poisson.  What is the story?  Suppose that you have two light bulbs.  One of them is red and flashes at random times that  are described according to a Poisson process  with a certain rate, lambda1.  The other light bulb is green, flashes also as a Poisson  process with a certain rate.  Furthermore, we assume that the two light bulbs  are independent of each other.  If you're color blind so that the only thing that you see  is flashes but without being able to tell the color,  what kind of process are you going to see?  Well, you will see a Poisson process also,  and at this point, you can probably  guess what the arrival rate is going  to be for this Poisson process.  It should be the sum of these two arrival  rates of the processes that you started with.  So this will be our final conclusion,  but we want to verify that this is indeed  the correct conclusion.  So let us look at the situation in some more detail.  We have the two processes, two arrival processes-- the red one  and the green one-- and the merged process  is formed by recording an arrival at any time where  either of the two processes that you  started with records an arrival.  Let us now look at the time interval  and think about the number of arrivals in the merged process  during this time interval.  What is that the number?  That number is equal to the number of arrivals  that you have in the first process plus  the number of arrivals that you have in the second process.  Let's call those numbers N1 and N2 so that what we have here  is N1 plus N2.  Now, N1 is a Poisson random variable  because this is a Poisson process.  Similarly, N2 is a Poisson random variable.  We assume that these two processes are independent.  Therefore, N1 plus N2 is the sum of independent Poisson  random variables, and therefore, N1 plus N2  is also a Poisson random variable.  This is reassuring.  It's a good piece of evidence that the blue process  is a Poisson process, but this is not enough.  To argue that it is a Poisson process,  we need to check the defining properties of a Poisson  process.  One defining property is the independence property.  If we take disjoint intervals, the number of arrivals  here is independent, or should be independent,  from the number of arrivals there.  The argument here is exactly the same as for the Bernoulli case,  so we will not go through it in any detail.  We just notice that whatever happens during that time  has to do with whatever happens during those times in the two  processes that we started with.  And similarly, what happens in these times  has to do with what happens in these two processes  during those times.  Because for each one of the two processes that we start with,  we have the Poisson assumption so that this interval  is independent from that interval in the sense  that arrivals here and arrivals there are independent.  So because of this, whatever happens during those  times has nothing to do with whatever  happens in those times, so number of arrivals  here is independent from the number of arrivals there.  The other property that we need to check  is that the probability of recording an arrival  during a small time interval of length delta,  that this probability has the right scaling  properties, that it is linear in delta,  in the length of this interval, and that the probability of two  or more arrivals here is negligible.  To see what happens during a typical interval in the merged  process, we need to consider what  is going to happen during that typical interval  in the other two processes and consider  all the possible combinations.  During a little interval, the red process  is going to have zero arrivals with this probability,  one arrival with this probability,  and two or more arrivals with this probability, which  is negligible.  Actually here, we're ignoring terms of order delta squared.  These are the correct expressions  if we only focus on terms that are either constants or linear  in delta.  We are ignoring terms that are of order delta  square or higher.  And similarly for the green process,  we have these probabilities for the number of arrivals  that may happen during a small interval.  For the merged process, we will have zero arrivals if and only  if we have zero arrivals in the red process  and zero arrivals in the green process.  The probability of these two events happening,  because we assume that the two processes that we started with  are independent, is going to be the product  of the probabilities of zero arrivals in one process times  zero arrivals in the other process.  We multiply those two terms, and if we throw away  the term delta squared, which is negligible,  we see that this event is going to happen with probability 1  minus lambda1 plus lambda2 times delta.  What's the probability that we get one arrival?  This is an event that can happen in two ways.  We could have one arrival in the red process  and zero arrivals in the green process,  and this combination happens with this probability.  Alternatively, we could have one arrival in the green process  and zero arrivals in the red process.  This is this event and it happens with this probability.  Having one arrival in the blue process  can happen either this way or that way,  so the probability of one arrival  will be the sum of these two probabilities.  And if we throw away terms that are  order of delta squared, what we're left with  is just lambda1 plus lambda2 times delta.  Finally, there's the possibility that the blue process  is going to have two or more arrivals.  This happens if we have one red and one green arrival,  which happens with this probability,  or if anyone of the processes has two or more arrivals, which  would be terms here, here, and these would be the scenarios.  But we notice that each one of these scenarios  has probability that's order of delta squared.  This term also has probability of order delta squared,  so overall, the possibility that the blue process has  two or more arrivals-- this is something that has probability  that's of order delta squared.  So during a typical small interval,  there is probability proportional  to the length of the interval of having one arrival,  and lambda1 plus lambda2 is the factor of this proportionality,  and the remaining probability is assigned to the event  that there are zero arrivals.  There's essentially negligible probability  of having two or more arrivals, but this  together with the independence assumption  is exactly what comes in the definition of a Poisson process  with an arrival rate equal to this number.  And so we have established that the merged process  is a Poisson process whose rate is  the sum of the rates of the processes that we started from.
