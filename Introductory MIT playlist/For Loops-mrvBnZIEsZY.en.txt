I'm going to go through all of these values  and you guys have already told me what values these are,  5, 7, 9, not 11.  And I'm going to add to mysum.  So I'm going to keep a running sum adding all of these values  together.  So the very first time through the loop, mysum  gets the value of 5.  That's this line here.  The next thing I see inside this loop is an if statement.  If mysum is equal to 5.  That's true.  So I'm going to go inside this if statement.  The next thing I see is a break.  If I see this break am I evaluating--  am I evaluating this line or not?  No, exactly.  Because whenever Python sees break, it's going to say,  I'm going to stop right here, exit out of the loop  that I'm currently in, and go to the statement that's  immediately right after it.  So what this is going to print is mysum.  And that's the exercise we were looking at.  Let's see how the class did.  Pretty good.  Hopefully if you answered one of these,  the explanation was-- was all right.  If not, just go back and try to work through it step by step.
