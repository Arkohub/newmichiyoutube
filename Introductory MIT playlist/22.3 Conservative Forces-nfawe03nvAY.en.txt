 We consider the work done by a gravitational force, which  was path-independent.  Now let's generalize that to any force between two points,  i, and another point, f, that if the work done  going from the initial point to the final point--  this is path-independent-- then we call this  force a conservative force.  There are many conservative forces  that we'll analyze in this class.  Examples will be the inverse square, electric force,  or the gravitational force.  We've already seen gravitational force.  Near the surface of the Earth is conservative.  Spring forces are other examples of conservative forces.  But let's look a little bit in detail.  Suppose we call this path 1 and we  consider a second path, path 2.  Then a property of conservative forces  is that the work done is independent of that path.  So if we total up the work from the initial  to final on path 1 of f dot ds.  And then we go from the final point  to the initial point on path 2 of f dot ds.  Then because these intervals are independent of the path,  and all we've done is shifted the endpoints, we get 0.  And that's the statement.  And we'll write w conservative here for conservative forces.  So we're going to call this force conservative  if it's path-independent.  So what we have here is the statement  that the work done by a conservative force.  Now what we'll do here, is indicate a circle  by a closed path.  The work done by conservative force on a closed path is zero.  What does a closed path look like?  Well, remember, what we did was we went from 1, but then  instead of going in this direction,  we came back on path to, from the final,  to the initial point.  And if the force is conservative,  the work done around a closed path is 0.
