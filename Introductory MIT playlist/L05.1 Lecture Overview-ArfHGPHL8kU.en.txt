 In this lecture, we introduce the  notion of a random variable.  A random variable is, loosely speaking, a numerical quantity  whose value is determined by the outcome of a probabilistic  experiment.  The weight of a randomly selected  student is one example.  After giving a general definition, we will focus  exclusively on discrete random variables.  These are random variables that take values in finite or  countably infinite sets.  For example, random variables that take  integer values are discrete.  To any discrete random variable we will associate a  probability mass function, which tells us the likelihood  of each possible value of the random variable.  Then we will go over a few examples and introduce some  common types of random variables.  And finally we will introduce a new concept- the expected  value of the random variable, also called the  expectation or mean.  It is a weighted average of the values of the random  variable, weighted according to their respective  probabilities, and has an intuitive interpretation as  the average value we expect to see if we repeat the same  probabilistic experiment independently a  large number of times.  Expected values play a central role in probability theory.  We will look into some of their properties.  And we will also calculate the expected values of the example  random variables that we will have introduced.
