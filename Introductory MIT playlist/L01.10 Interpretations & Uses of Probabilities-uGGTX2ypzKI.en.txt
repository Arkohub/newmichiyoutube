 We end this lecture sequence by stepping back to discuss  what probability theory really is and what exactly is the  meaning of the word probability.  In the most narrow view, probability theory is just a  branch of mathematics.  We start with some axioms.  We consider models that satisfy these axioms, and we  establish some consequences, which are the  theorems of this theory.  You could do all that without ever asking the question of  what the word "probability" really means.  Yet, one of the theorems of probability theory, that we  will see later in this class, is that probabilities can be  interpreted as frequencies, very loosely speaking.  If I have a fair coin, and I toss it infinitely many times,  then the fraction of heads that I will  observe will be one half.  In this sense, the probability of an event, A, can be  interpreted as the frequency with which event A will occur  in an infinite number of repetitions of the experiment.  But is this all there is?  If we're dealing with coin tosses, it makes sense to  think of probabilities as frequencies.  But consider a statement such as the "current president of  my country will be reelected in the next election with  probability 0.7".  It's hard to think of this number, 0.7, as a frequency.  It does not make sense to think of infinitely many  repetitions of the next election.  In cases like this, and in many others, it is better to  think of probabilities as just some way of  describing our beliefs.  And if you're a betting person, probabilities can be  thought of as some numerical guidance into what kinds of  bets you might be willing to make.  But now if we think of probabilities as beliefs, you  can run into the argument that, well, beliefs are  subjective.  Isn't probability theory supposed to be an objective  part of math and science?  Is probability theory just an exercise in subjectivity?  Well, not quite.  There's more to it.  Probability, at the minimum, gives us some rules for  thinking systematically about uncertain situations.  And if it happens that our probability model, our  subjective beliefs, have some relation with the real world,  then probability theory can be a very useful tool for making  predictions and decisions that apply to the real world.  Now, whether your predictions and decisions will be any good  will depend on whether you have chosen a good model.  Have you chosen a model that's provides a good enough  representation of the real world?  How do you make sure that this is the case?  There's a whole field, the field of statistics, whose  purpose is to complement probability theory by using  data to come up with good models.  And so we have the following diagram that summarizes the  relation between the real world, statistics, and  probability.  The real world generates data.  The field of statistics and inference uses these data to  come up with probabilistic models.  Once we have a probabilistic model, we use probability  theory and the analysis tools that it provides to us.  And the results that we get from this analysis lead to  predictions and decisions about the real world.
