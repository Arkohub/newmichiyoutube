 In the previous example, we had a model where the result  of the first coin toss did not affect the probabilities of  what might happen in the second toss.  This is a phenomenon that we call independence and which we  now proceed to define.  Let us start with a first attempt at the definition.  We have an event, B, that has a certain  probability of occurring.  We are then told that event A occurred, but suppose that  this knowledge does not affect our beliefs about B in the  sense that the conditional probability remains the same  as the original unconditional probability.  Thus, the occurrence of A provides no new information  about B. In such a case, we may say that event B is  independent from event A.  If this is indeed the case, notice that the probability  that both A and B occur, which is always equal by the  multiplication rule to the probability of A times the  conditional probability of B given A. So this is a relation  that's always true.  But if we also have this additional condition, then  this simplifies to the probability of A times the  probability of B.  So we can find the probability of both events happening by  just multiplying their individual probabilities.  It turns out that this relation is a cleaner way of  the defining formally the notion of independence.  So we will say that two events, A and B, are  independent if this relation holds.  Why do we use this definition rather than the original one?  This formal definition has several advantages.  First, it is consistent with the earlier definition.  If this equality is true, then the conditional probability of  event B given A, which is the ratio of this divided by that,  will be equal to the probability of B. So if this  relation holds, then this relation will also hold, and  so this more formal definition is consistent with our earlier  intuitive definition.  A more important reason is that this formal definition is  symmetric with respect to the roles of A and B. So instead  of saying that B is independent from A, based on  this definition we can now say that events A and B are  independent of each other.  And in addition, since this definition is symmetric and  since it implies this condition, it must also imply  the symmetrical relation.  Namely, that the conditional probability of A given B is  the same as the unconditional probability of A.  Finally, on the technical side, conditional  probabilities are only defined when the conditioning event  has non-zero probability.  So this original definition would only make sense in those  cases where the probability of the event A would be non-zero.  In contrast, this new definition makes sense even  when we're dealing with zero probability events.  So this definition is indeed more general, and this also  makes it more elegant.  Let us now build some understanding of what  independence really is.  Suppose that we have two events, A and B, both of which  have positive probability.  And furthermore, these two events are disjoint.  They do not have any common elements.  Are these two events independent?  Let us check the definition.  The probability that both A and B occur is zero because  the two events are disjoint.  They cannot happen together.  On the other hand, the probability of A times the  probability of B is positive, since each one of the two  terms is positive.  And therefore, these two expressions are different from  each other, and therefore this equality that's required by  the definition of independence does not hold.  The conclusion is that these two events are not  independent.  In fact, intuitively, these two events are as dependent as  Siamese twins.  If you know that A occurred, then you are sure  that B did not occur.  So the occurrence of A tells you a lot about the occurrence  or non-occurrence of B.  So we see that being independent is something  completely different from being disjoint.  Independence is a relation about information.  It is important to always keep in mind the intuitive meaning  of independence.  Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event  does not change our beliefs about the other.  It does not affect the probability that the other  event also occurs.  When do we have independence in the real world?  The typical case is when the occurrence or non-occurrence  of each of the two events A and B is determined by two  physically distinct and non-interacting processes.  For example, whether my coin results in heads and whether  it will be snowing on New Year's Day are two events that  should be modeled as independent.  But I should also say that there are some cases where  independence is less obvious and where it happens through a  numerical accident.  You can now move on to answer some simple questions where  you will have to check for independence using either the  mathematical or intuitive definition.
