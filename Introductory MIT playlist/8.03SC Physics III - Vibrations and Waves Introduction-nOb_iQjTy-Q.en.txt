 [MUSIC PLAYING]  YEN-JIE LEE: 8.03 is a very, very interesting course,  because without waves and vibrations  we will not be able to even recognize this universe.  Doing this class, I decided to include a lot of demos  during my lectures.  Demonstrations are particularly useful,  because we first introduce the physical situation  we are interested.  Then we compare our mathematical solution  to reality, which is actually the demo.  I hope you will be able to enjoy this free content provided  by OCW, including the lecture videos,  the lecture notes, and the problem solving video  from Professor Wit Busza.  Yeah, it's really cool.  You'll take the course, right?
