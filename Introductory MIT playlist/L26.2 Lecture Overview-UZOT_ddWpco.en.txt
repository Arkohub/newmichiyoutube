 So we have reached the final lecture  of this class which will also conclude  our study of discrete time, finite state space  Markov chains.  We will first review the steady-state behavior  of Markov chains.  Then, we are going to talk about a classical application  of Markov chains to analyze the design of a phone system.  And finally, we will see how we can calculate  some interesting quantities that have  to do with the behavior of Markov chains  over a finite time horizon as opposed to in the long run.  So let us start.
