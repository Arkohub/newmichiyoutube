 We begin with multiplication of a vector by a scalar.  When you multiply a vector, A, by a scalar,  this multiplicative factor just rescales the magnitude  or the length of the vector.  Let us look at the vector 2 times  A. This is in the same direction as the vector A,  but is twice as long.  This is vector B. A vector is defined  by its magnitude and direction.  So this vector B is the same anywhere in space,  including at the origin.  If I want minus 0.5 times B, this vector  is in the opposite direction of B and is half the length.  Now let's look at vector addition.  Here's a vector A. Here is B. How do we add them graphically?  We slide the tail of B to the head of A.  And their sum is a vector drawn from the tail of A  to the head of B. I could have also added A to B  by sliding the tail of A to the head of B.  You can see that this makes a parallelogram,  and the sum, vector C, is just the diagonal  of this parallelogram.  Subtraction can be thought of as just multiplication  and addition.  If I have C is equal to A minus B,  I just need to add A to the vector minus B. Minus B  is negative 1 times B, which is this vector here.  Now I only have to add A to minus B.  Let's do another example.  Here are my vectors A and B do not start at the origin.  But since vectors are the same anywhere in space,  I can go through the process here.  I want A minus B. So I first multiply B by minus 1  to find minus B. And then I move the tail of minus B  to the head of A and add the two like this.
