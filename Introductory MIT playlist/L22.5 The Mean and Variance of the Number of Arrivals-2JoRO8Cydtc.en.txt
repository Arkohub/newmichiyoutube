 Now that we have in our hands the PMF  of the random variable N tau, which is the number of arrivals  during an interval of length tau,  we can go ahead and try to calculate  the mean and variance of this quantity.  Regarding the mean, we could use just the definition  of the expected value and then carry out  of this calculation, which is not too hard.  And in the end, we would obtain an answer equal to lambda times  tau.  This is indeed the correct formula for the expected value.  But let us understand why this formula should  be true without doing any calculation.  Remember that the random variable, the number  of arrivals in the Poisson process,  is well approximated by a binomial random variable  with those particular parameters n and p in the limit  when delta goes to zero.  And this works through a discretization argument.  Therefore, the expected value of N tau  should be approximately equal to the expected value of that we  get from the Bernoulli processes, that is the expected  value of the binomial random variable.  And the expected value of a binomial random variable  is n times p.  And n times p evaluates approximately to lambda times  tau.  The second equality here is approximate because we're  neglecting this order of delta squared term.  Now, these approximations are increasingly  exact as we let delta go to 0.  And when we take the limit as delta goes to 0,  we see that the expected value of the number of arrivals  in the Poisson process will be equal to lambda tau.  For the variance, we can follow a similar argument.  First do a binomial approximation  and use the formula for the variance  of a binomial random variable.  And then, when delta is small, this number p is small.  And it's negligible compared to 1.  n times p is approximately lambda [tau].  And so we obtain this expression  This expression here is the correct one.  If we were to use the formal definition of the variance  and carry out the calculations using the PMF,  this is what we would obtain, except that it  would be somewhat tedious.  The formulas that we have derived,  at least the first one, is quite intuitive  and has a natural form.  The expected number of arrivals is proportional to tau.  If we double the length of the time interval for interest,  we expect to see twice as many arrivals.  This formula also reinforces the interpretation of lambda  as an arrival rate.  Since lambda is the expected number of arrivals divided  by the length of time, it is, really,  the expected number of arrivals per unit time.  So it's natural to call lambda the arrival rate,  or the intensity of the arrival process.  Finally, regarding the variance, it is a curious fact  that the variance turns out to be  exactly the same as the expected value.  And this is a special property of the Poisson PMF.
