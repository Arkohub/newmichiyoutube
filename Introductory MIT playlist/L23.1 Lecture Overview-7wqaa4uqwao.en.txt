 In this lecture, we look in some depth into various  properties of Poisson processes.  These properties would be quite hard to study if one  were to proceed just analytically by  manipulating formulas.  However, by using memorylessness and our  intuitive understanding of what the Poisson process  really is, they become quite simple.  And the mathematical manipulations can be avoided  almost entirely.  We will start by arguing that the sum of independent Poisson  random variables is Poisson.  But we will then establish the much stronger statement that  if we merge two independent Poisson processes, we, again,  obtain a Poisson process.  We will see that we can exploit this fact to solve  some problems that would be quite difficult otherwise.  Once more, intuitive reasoning is the key.  Finally, we will spend some time discussing a phenomenon  that goes under the name of random incidence.  The Poisson process has been running.  You show up at a certain time.  You look at the size of the inter-arrival interval during  which you show up.  It turns out that this inter-arrival interval that  you get to observe is not a typical one.  It tends to be larger than the typical  inter-arrival interval.  We will understand what exactly is going on, build  some intuition, and realize that this is a general  phenomenon that also shows up in many other contexts.
