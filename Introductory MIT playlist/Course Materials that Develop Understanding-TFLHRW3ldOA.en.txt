 AUDIENCE: You've had a chance to look over  the syllabus for this course.  What value do you think it might have for learners  in the outside world, and would you  recommend that they take a look at these readings  and try to apply them to their own lives?  NOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah, quite definitely.  I mean, if we want to have any constructive impact  on the world, any interchange with the world that  will improve it will deal with the innumerable problems that  exist.  It has to be based on understanding  of social, political, economic reality.  Otherwise, you can't act in any serious way,  just as you couldn't go into a chemistry lab  and conduct an experiment unless you knew something  about chemistry.  Otherwise, you could mix chemicals and make funny smells  and so on.  But if you want to do something serious,  you have to understand first.  And the syllabus of the course and conduct of the course  is aimed at and I think succeeds in providing  the kind of fundamental understanding and challenge  open questions that people have to think about  if they want to be able to participate  in a meaningful way in the general society.
