 Here we will learn to distinguish  between vectors and scalars.  Vectors are objects that have both a magnitude,  a single number, and a direction.  Whereas scalars have only a magnitude.  Let's see some examples of each.  The length of something is a scalar  because it's just the magnitude.  A force exerted by someone pulling something  is a vector because we care about the strength  of the force, the magnitude, and the direction  in which the force is acting.  Temperature-- it's a scalar.  If we display temperature on a weather map  where the value of the temperature  is different at each point in space, this is a scalar field.  In comparison, this weather map of wind  where the value of the wind velocity at each point in space  is represented by a vector is a vector field.
