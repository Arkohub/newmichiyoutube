 Let us now revisit the second calculation that we carried  out in the context of our earlier example.  In that example, we calculated the total probability of an  event that can occur under different scenarios.  And it involves the powerful idea of divide and conquer  where we break up complex situations  into simpler pieces.  Here is what is involved.  We have our sample space.  And our sample space is partitioned into a number of  subsets or events.  In this picture we take that number to be 3, so we'll have  it partitioned into three possible scenarios.  It is a partition which means that these events cover the  entire sample, space and they're  disjoint from each other.  For each one of the scenarios we're given their  probabilities.  If you prefer, you can also draw this situation  in terms of a tree.  There are three different scenarios that can happen.  We're interested in a particular event, B. That  event B can happen in three different ways.  It can happen under scenario one, under scenario two, or  under scenario three.  And this corresponds to these particular sub-events.  So for example, this is the event  where scenario A1 happens.  And then event B happens as well.  In terms of a tree diagram, the  picture becomes as follows.  If scenario A1 materializes, event B may occur or event B  might not occur.  Finally, we are given conditional probabilities that  event B will materialize under each one of the different  possible scenarios.  Under those circumstances, can we calculate the probability  of event B?  Of course we can.  And here's how we do it.  First we realize that event B consists of a number of  disjoint pieces.  One piece is when event B occurs together with event A1.  Another piece is when event B occurs together with A2.  Another piece is when event B occurs together with A3.  These three sets are disjoint from each other, as we see in  this picture.  And together they form the event B. Therefore, the  probability of B is going to be, by the additivity axiom of  probabilities, equal to the sum of the probabilities of  these sub-events.  Furthermore, for each one of these sub-events we can use  the multiplication rule and write their  probabilities as follows.  The probability that B and A1 both occur is the probability  that scenario one materializes times the conditional  probability that B occurs given that A1 occurred.  And then we're going to have similar terms under the second  scenario and a similar term under the third scenario.  So putting everything together, we have arrived at a  formula of this form.  The total probability of event B is the sum of the  probabilities of the different ways that B may occur, that  is, B occurring under the different scenarios.  And those particular probabilities are the product  of the probability of the scenario times the conditional  probability of B given that scenario.  Now, note that the sum of the probabilities of the different  scenarios is of course equal to 1.  And this is because the scenarios form a partition of  our sample space.  So if we look at this formula here, we realize that it is a  weighted average of the conditional probabilities of  event B, weighted average of the conditional probabilities  where these probabilities of the individual scenarios are  the weights.  In words, the probability that an event occurs is a weighted  average of the probability that it has under each  possible scenario, where the weights are the probabilities  of the different scenarios.  One final comment--  our derivation was for the case of three events.  But you can certainly see that the same derivation would go  through if we had any finite number of events.  But even more, if we had a partition of our sample space  into an infinite sequence of events, the same derivation  would still go through, except that in this place in the  derivation, instead of using the ordinary additivity axiom  we would have to use the countable additivity axiom.  But other than that, all the steps would be the same.  And we would end up with the same formula, except that now  this would be an infinite sum over the  infinite set of scenarios.
