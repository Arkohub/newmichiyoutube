 We now look at representing vectors by their magnitude  and direction.  In this example, we have a force here.  We can represent this force by its magnitude, which  is the length of the vector, and the angle from the x-axis  going towards the y-axis.  We can also separately represent the velocity  as a vector with its own magnitude and direction.  Notice that in this example the velocity  is in a different direction than the force.
