 We will now go through an example, which is essentially  a drill, to consolidate our understanding of the  conditional expectation and the conditional variance.  Consider a random variable X, which is continuous and is  described by a PDF of this form.  Whenever we have a PDF that seems to consist of different  pieces, it's always useful to divide and conquer.  And the way we will do that will be to consider two  different scenarios.  That X falls in this range.  And in that scenario, we say that the certain random  variable Y is equal to 1.  And another scenario in which X falls in this range, and in  that case, we say that Y is equal to 2.  Let us now look at the conditional expectation of X  given Y. What is it?  Well, it is a random variable which can take a different  values depending on what Y is.  If Y happens to take a value of 1, then  we are in this range.  And the conditional PDF of X, given that Y falls in this  range, keeps the same shape, it's uniform.  And so it's mean is going to be equal to the midpoint of  this interval, which is 1/2.  And this is something that happens when Y is equal to 1.  What is the probability of this happening?  The probability that Y is equal to 1 is the area under  the PDF in this range.  And since the height of the PDF is 1/2, this  probability is 1/2.  The alternative scenario is that Y happens to take the  value of 2.  In which case, X lives in this interval.  Given that X has fallen in this interval, the conditional  expectation of X is the midpoint of this interval.  And the midpoint of this interval is at 2.  And this is an event that, again, happens with  probability 1/2, because the area under the PDF in this  region is equal to 1/2.  So the conditional expectation is a random variable that  takes these values with these probabilities.  Since we now have a complete probabilistic description of  this random variable, we're able to calculate the  expectation of this random variable.  What is it?  With probability 1/2, the random variable takes the  value of 1/2.  And with probability 1/2, it takes a value of 2.  And so the expected value of the conditional  expectation is 5/4.  But the law of iterated expectations tells us that  this quantity is also the same as the expected value of X. So  we have managed to find the expected value of X by the  divide and conquer method, by considering different cases.  Let us now turn to the conditional variance of X  given Y. Once more, this quantity is a random variable.  The value of that quantity depends on what Y  turns out to be.  And we have, again, the same two possibilities.  Y could be equal to 1, or Y could be equal to 2.  And these possibilities happen with equal probabilities.  If Y is equal to 1, conditional on that event, X  has a uniform PDF on this range, on an interval of  length one.  And we know that the variance of a uniform PDF on an  interval of length one is 1/12.  If on the other hand, Y takes a value of 2, then X is a  uniform random variable on an interval of length 2.  And the variance in this case is 2 squared, where this 2  stands for the length of the interval, divided by 12, which  is the same as 4/12.  So we now have a complete probabilistic description of  the conditional variance as a random variable.  It's a random variable that with these probabilities,  takes these two particular values.  Since we know the distribution of this random variable, we  can certainly calculate its expected value.  And the expected value is found as follows.  With probability 1/2, the random variable of interest  takes a value of 1/12.  And with probability 1/2, this random variable  takes a value of 4/12.  And this number happens to be 5/24.  Finally, let us calculate the variance of the conditional  expectation.  Since we have complete information about the  distribution of the conditional expectation,  calculating its variance is not going to be difficult.  So what is it?  With probability 1/2, the conditional expectation takes  a value of 1/2.  We subtract from this is the mean of the conditional  expectation, which is 5/4.  And we take the square of that.  So this term is the square or the deviation of the value of  the random variable of 1/2 from the mean  of that random variable.  And we get a similar term.  If Y happens to be equal to 2.  With probability 1/2 half, our random variable takes a value  of 2, which is so much away from the mean  of the random variable.  And then we square that quantity.  If we carry out the algebra, the answer turns out  to be 9 over 16.  And now we can go back to the law of the total variance and  calculate that the total variance is equal to the  expected value of the variance, which is 5/24.  And then we have the variance of the expected  value, which is 9/16.  And this number evaluates to 37/48.  So we have managed to find the variance of this random  variable using the divide and conquer methods and the law of  the total variance.
