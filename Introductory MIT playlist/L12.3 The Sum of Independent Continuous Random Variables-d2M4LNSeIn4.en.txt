 We now develop a methodology for finding the PDF of the sum  of two independent random variables, when these random  variables are continuous with known PDFs.  So in that case, Z will also be continuous and  so will have a PDF.  The development is quite analogous to the one for the  discrete case.  And in the discrete case, we obtained  this convolution formula.  This convolution formula corresponds to a summation  over all ways that a certain sum can be realized.  In this picture, these are all the ways that the sum of 3 can  be realized.  In the continuous case, the different ways that the  constant sum can be realized corresponds to a line.  So this is a line in which X plus Y is equal to a constant.  And we need to somehow add over all the possible ways  that the sum can be obtained, add over all the  points on this line.  Now, when we're summing over all the points of the line we  really need to employ an integral.  And this leads to the following  guess for the formula.  Instead of having a summation, we will have an integral.  And the integral is over all the X, Y pairs whose sum is a  constant number, little z.  So we have here the family recipe--  that sums are replaced by integrals and PMFs are  replaced by PDFs.  So this formula is entirely plausible.  And it is called the  continuous convolution formula.  What we want to do next is to actually justify this formula  more rigorously.  We will use the following trick.  We will first condition on the random variable X, taking on a  specific value.  If we do this conditioning, then the random variable Z  becomes little x plus Y. And to make the argument more  transparent, we're going to look first at the special case  where little x is let's say, the number 3.  In which case our random variable Z is  equal to Y plus 3.  Let us now calculate the conditional PDF of Z in a  universe in which we are told that the random variable X  takes on the value of 3.  Now, given that X takes on the value of 3, the random  variable Z is the same as the random variable Y plus 3.  And now we have the conditional PDF of y plus 3  given X.  However, we have assumed that X and Y are independent.  So the conditional PDF is going to be the same as the  unconditional PDF of Y plus 3.  And we obtain this expression.  Now, what is this?  We know the PDF of Y. But now we want the PDF of Y plus 3,  which is a simple version of a linear function of a single  random variable Y. For a linear function of this form,  we have already derived a formula.  In the notation we have used in the past, if we have a  random variable X, and we add the constant to it, the PDF of  the new random variable is the PDF of X but shifted by an  amount equal to b to the right.  And that's what the shifting corresponds to mathematically.  Now, let's us apply this formula to the case  that we have here.  We need to keep track of the different symbols.  So capital Y corresponds to X, b corresponds to 3, little x  corresponds to Z. And by using these correspondences, what we  obtain is f sub Y of this argument, which is Z in our  case minus b, which is 3 in our case.  And this is the final form for the conditional density of Z  given that X takes a specific value.  It's nothing more than the density of Y, but shifted by 3  units to the right.  Let us now generalize this.  Instead of using X equal to 3, let us use a general number.  And this gives us the more general formula, that the  conditional PDF of Z given that X takes on a specific  value is equal to--  just use little x here instead of 3.  It takes this form.  So we do have now in our hands a formula for the conditional  density of Z given X.  Since we have the conditional, and we also know the PDF of X,  we can use the multiplication rule to find the joint PDF of  X and Z. By the multiplication rule, it is the marginal PDF  of X times the conditional PDF of Z given X, which in our  case takes this particular form.  And now that we have the joint PDF in our hands, we can use  another familiar formula that takes us from the  joint to the marginal.  It would take the joint PDF and integrate with respect to  one argument, we obtain the marginal PDF of the other  random variable.  Using this specific form that we have for the joint PDF in  this formula, we have finally obtained this expression.  This is the integral of the joint PDF of X with Z  integrated over all xs.  And this proves this convolution formula.  In terms of the mechanics of carrying out the calculation  of the convolution, the mechanics are exactly the same  as in the discrete case.  If you want to solve a problem graphically, what you will do  is to take the PDF of Y, flip it horizontally, and then  shift it by an amount of little z, cross multiply  terms, and integrate them out.
