 In this segment, we make a connection between the  correlation coefficient and some fairly realistic real  world situations.  The bottom line will be that the presence or absence of  correlations can make a huge difference.  Suppose that you run an investment company that  invests in real estate, and you have 100 million of  capital that you want to invest.  Now you have learned or believe that it helps to  diversify, to not put all of your eggs in the same basket.  And for that reason, you're going to invest some of your  money into different states.  You will be investing in 10 different states, and in each  state, you will invest 10 million so that your total  investment is spread between those 10 states.  For each state, you have a model that tells you that the  return on your investment, that is your profit--  It's, of course, random, but you expect it to be 1 million  on the average, that is, in terms of the expected value,  but there's also a fair amount of randomness, and so the  standard deviation is 1.3.  Now, if you look at one state in isolation, it would be a  pretty risky investment because the standard deviation  is comparable to the mean.  It's not an unlikely event to have a return that's one  standard deviation below the mean.  And if that happens, your return is going to be  negative, and you're losing money.  But then you argue that you're investing in  10 different states.  Yes, you might lose money in some of them, but overall, you  would expect to have a pretty high confidence that you will  end up having a positive return.  Is this correct or not?  Let us do some calculations.  We will look at the variance of your total return.  The variance of the sum of random variables is given by  the formula that we have developed.  It's the sum of the variances.  But then you also have a bunch of covariance terms that have  to do with the relation of the different random variables.  Now, you make the assumption that the different states are  different markets--  one doesn't affect the other--  so that the Xi's are uncorrelated.  In that case, in this variance formula, the covariance terms  are all 0, and they disappear and you're left with the sum  of 10 variance terms.  Now, each one of these variances is equal to the  square of the standard deviation.  And we have a variance of 16.9.  You then take the square root to find the standard deviation  and the square root of this number is 4.1.  Now, your expected return is equal to 10, which is 2 and  1/2 standard deviations.  You will only lose money if the outcome is 2 and 1/2  standard deviations below the mean.  And that's a fairly unlikely outcome, and so in this  situation you feel very confident that you will have a  positive profit.  Suppose, however, that your assumption is wrong, and that  actually the different Xi's are  correlated with each other.  And suppose that the correlation is  pretty high, 0.9.  Essentially, this means that the real estate market in one  state is strongly related to the behavior of the market in  another state.  And that could be, perhaps, because the markets in  different states are affected by some more global phenomenon  that operates on a national level.  So in this case, the covariance of Xi with Xj is  going to be the correlation coefficient times the standard  deviation of Xi times the standard deviation of Xj,  which is 0.9 times 1.3 times 1.3.  And so the co-variance turns out to be 1.52.  And in that case, the variance of the sum, using this formula  here, is going to be equal to 10 times the variance that you  have in each state, which is 1.3 squared, plus you have a  bunch of terms here.  How many terms?  There's 90 of them, and each one of these  terms is equal to 1.52.  And the variance turns out to be 154.  Now you take the square root of that, and you find a  standard deviation of 12.4.  Now, your expected profit is 10, but the standard  deviation is 12.4.  And if you happen to be one standard deviation below the  expectation, which is something that has a sizable  probability of occurring, then your profit  is going to be negative.  So in the uncorrelated case, you're pretty certain that you  will have a positive profit, but if the correlations  actually turn out to be significant, then you're  facing a very risky situation.  To some extent, this is similar to what happened  during the great financial crisis.  That is, many investment companies thought that they  were secure by diversifying and by investing in different  housing markets in different states, but then when the  economy moved as a whole, it turned out that there were  high correlations between the different states, and so the  unthinkable, that is large losses, actually did occur.
