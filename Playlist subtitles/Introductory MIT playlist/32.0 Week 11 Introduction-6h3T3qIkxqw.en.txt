 We recently introduced a vector quantity called torque--  a sort of rotational analog to force.  And we saw that an applied torque changes the angular  motion of a rotating body in just the same way  that an applied force changes the linear motion  of a translating body.  This week, we're going to introduce  the concept of angular momentum, which  relates to torque and rotational motion in the same way  that ordinary momentum relates to force  and translation of motion.  Like torque, angular momentum is defined  in terms of a cross product or a vector product.  Specifically, the angular momentum vector L for a point  mass is equal to the cross product R cross P ,  where R is the position vector measured from a chosen  reference point and P is the ordinary momentum vector.  We will also encounter a third conservation principle,  this time for angular momentum.  An applied torque causes the angle the moment of to change.  However, if there are no external torques on a system,  then the angular momentum of the system  is conserved or remains constant.  This is a powerful tool for solving many problems.  One subtlety is that angular momentum like torque  is defined relative to a specified point.  So for a given system, the angular momentum  with respect to one point might be conserved,  while the angular momentum with respect to a different point  might be changing.  Often in analyzing the system, we  must be careful about our choice of reference point  for torques and angular momentum in order  to take full advantage of the conservation principle.  Angular momentum is a particularly  subtle and non-intuitive concept in comparison  to momentum and energy.  And the resulting motion is often surprising.  It is worthy of particularly careful study.
