 The weak law of large numbers tells us  that the sample mean--  that is, the average of independent identically  distributed random variables, Xi--  converges, in a certain sense, to a number, namely the  expected value of the random variables, Xi.  But it does not tell us much about the details of the  distribution of the sample mean.  The central limit theorem provides us exactly with this  kind of detail.  It tells us that the sum of many independent identically  distributed random variables has approximately a normal  distribution.  The mean and variance of this normal is easy to find if we  know the mean and variance of the original random variables.  This enables us to carry out approximate calculations  rather quickly by using the normal tables.  We will start with a precise statement of the central limit  theorem, and we will emphasize that it is a universal result.  It holds no matter what the distribution of the original  random variables, and for this reason, it is very useful.  We will work through several examples of the typical ways  that the central limit theorem is used.  We will develop a refinement that can be used when we are  dealing with discrete distributions, which provides  us with even more accurate approximations.  And finally we will revisit the polling problem, and  inquire again about the number of samples that are needed to  obtain a certain accuracy with a certain confidence.  We will see that the central limit theorem is much more  informative, much less conservative, compared to the  conclusions that we had gotten before based on the Chebyshev  inequality.
