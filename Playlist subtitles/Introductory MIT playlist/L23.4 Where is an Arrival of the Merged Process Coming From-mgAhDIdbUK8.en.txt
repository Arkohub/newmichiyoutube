 As before, we have a red Poisson process and a green Poisson  process.  We merge these two processes, and we only  observe the merged process.  Here's an interesting question.  This is an arrival of the merged process.  Where did it come from?  Is it red, or is it green?  We cannot know, but can we tell what is the probability that it  came from the red stream?  The way to answer this question is  to look at the table of all the things  that can happen during a little interval  around that particular time in which we had an arrival.  We are told that there was an arrival at time t or an arrival  during an interval, a small interval around time t.  This means that we're told that this event here has happened.  Given this information, what is the conditional probability  that actually this event here occurred?  This is just the fraction of this probability divided  by the total probability of the conditioning event.  So the answer is lambda 1 divided  by lambda 1 plus lambda 2.  Does this answer make sense?  Well, suppose that lambda 1 and lambda 2 were equal.  In that case, by symmetry, when an arrival comes,  it should be equally likely to have come either from the red  or from the green stream.  And this is consistent with this answer.  We can reason similarly for a slightly different question.  You wait until the kth arrival, let's say the third arrival.  Where did that arrival come from?  Well, that case, arrival occurred  during a specific little time interval and conditioning  on it having occurred during that particular time interval,  we can then repeat the reasoning that we had here and argue  that given that we had an arrival-- it just happens  to be the third arrival during that time interval--  there's going to be this particular conditional  probability that it came from the red stream.  So we obtained the same answer once more.  Now, this arrival came from one of the two streams  with some probabilities.  This arrival came from one of the two streams  with some probabilities.  Does the origin of this arrival affect or depend  on the origin of that arrival?  Because we have assumed independence  across time for each one of the processes  that we started with-- and therefore, we also  have the same thing for the merged process-- whatever  has to do with events during this interval  is independent from anything that  has to do with events in that interval.  And because of this, one could argue formally--  but hopefully, this is intuitive enough--  that the origin of this arrival and the origin of that arrival  are independent events.  And now that we have this property,  we can answer questions such as the following.  We've had 10 arrivals so far.  What is the probability that exactly four out of these 10  are red?  Each one of those arrivals has this probability of being red.  The origin of different arrivals are independent of each other.  So essentially, we're dealing with 10 Bernoulli trials,  each of which has two possible outcomes, red or green,  and is red with this particular probability.  Therefore, the answer is going to be  given by the binomial probabilities, which  is the probability of having four successes in 10 trials.  And we obtain lambda 1 over lambda 1 plus lambda 2.  That's the probability of a red to the number of red arrivals.  And then the remaining probability,  1 minus that, which is lambda 2 over lambda 1  plus lambda 2 to the remaining power, which is equal to 6.  So to summarize.  Each one of the arrivals in the merged process  has a certain probability of being  a red arrival or a green arrival.  Which one of the two is the case?  We can think of it as an outcome of Bernoulli trial,  and the Bernoulli trials associated  with different arrivals are independent of each other  as a consequence of the independence of Poisson  processes across time.
