 As promised, we will now start developing generalizations of  the different calculations that we carried out in the  context of the radar example.  The first kind of calculation that we carried out goes under  the name of the multiplication rule.  And it goes as follows.  Our starting point is the definition of conditional  probabilities.  The conditional probability of A given another event, B, is  the probability that both events have occurred divided  by the probability of the conditioning event.  We now take the denominator term and send it to the other  side of this equality to obtain this relation, which we  can interpret as follows.  The probability that two events occur is equal to the  probability that a first event occurs, event B in this case,  times the conditional probability that the second  event, event A, occurs, given that event B has occurred.  Now, out of the two events, A and B, we're of course free to  choose which one we call the first event and which one we  call the second event.  So the probability of the two events happening is also equal  to an expression of this form, the probability that A occurs  times the conditional probability that B occurs,  given that A has occurred.  We used this formula in the context of a tree diagram.  And we used it to calculate the probability of a leaf of  this tree by multiplying the probability of taking this  branch, the probability that A occurs, times the conditional  probability of taking this branch, the probability that  event B also occurs given that event A has occurred.  How do we generalize this calculation?  Consider a situation in which the experiment has an  additional third stage that has to do with another event,  C, that may or may not occur.  For example, if we have arrived here, A and B have  both occurred.  And then C also occurs, then we reach this particular leaf  of the tree.  Or there could be other scenarios.  For example, it could be the case that A did not occur.  Then event B occurred, and finally, event C did not  occur, in which case we end up at this particular leaf.  What is the probability of this scenario happening?  Let us try to do a calculation similar to the one that we  used for the case of two events.  However, we need to deal here with three events.  What should we do?  Well, we look at the intersection of these three  events and think of it as the intersection of a composite  event, A complement intersection B, then  intersected with the event C complement.  Clearly, you can form the intersection of three events  by first taking the intersection of two of them  and then intersecting with a third.  After we group things this way, we're dealing with the  probability of two events happening, this composite  event and this ordinary event.  And the probability of two events happening is equal to  the probability that the first event happens, and then the  probability that the second event happens, given that the  first one has happened.  Can we simplify this even further?  Yes.  The first term is the probability  of two events happening.  So it can be simplified further as the probability  that A complement occurs times the conditional probability  that B occurs, given that A complement has occurred.  And then we carry over the last term  exactly the way it is.  The conclusion is that we can calculate the probability of  this leaf by multiplying the probability of the first  branch times the conditional probability of the second  branch, given that the first branch was taken, and then  finally multiply with the probability of the third  branch, which is the probability that C complement  occurs, given that A complement and B  have already occurred.  In other words, we can calculate the probability of a  leaf by just multiplying the probabilities of the different  branches involved and where we use conditional probabilities  for the intermediate branches.  At this point, you can use your imagination to see that  such a formula should also be valid for the case of more  than three events.  The probability that a bunch of events all occur should be  the probability of the first event times a number of  factors, each corresponding to a branch in a  tree of this kind.  In particular, the probability that events A1, A2, up to An  all occur is going to be the probability that the first  event occurs times a product of conditional probabilities  that the i-th event occurs, given that all of the previous  events have already occurred.  And we obtain a term of this kind for every event, Ai,  after the first one, so this product ranges from 2 up to n.  And this is the most general version of the multiplication  rule and allows you to calculate the probability of  several events happening by multiplying probabilities and  conditional probabilities.
