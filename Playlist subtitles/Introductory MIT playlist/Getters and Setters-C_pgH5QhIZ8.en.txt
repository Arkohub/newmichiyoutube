The init method here takes in self as usual, a w, and a d.  So Car gets initialized with two parameters.  And we assign the wheels data attribute to the first one  and the doors data attribute to the second one.  And then we're going to also assign  the color data attribute to be the empty string.  So I'm giving you four choices here.  And the question says, which of the above  is a getter method for the number of wheels?  So getter method is something that's  going to get a data attribute.  A method is really just a function.  So of course, we're going to have def.  get_wheels is a good name for it.  Since it's a method for this class,  we have to have self in the parameters.  So we know it's going to be between C and D.  And so then what are we going to return?  The first one's going to return wheels, which,  in this particular case, is just going  to be a variable that we haven't defined, but it's a variable.  A getter returns a data attribute  of a particular instance.  So we actually have to say self dot  if we want to return a data attribute of an instance,  as opposed to just a regular variable.  So the correct answer is D. Great job.
