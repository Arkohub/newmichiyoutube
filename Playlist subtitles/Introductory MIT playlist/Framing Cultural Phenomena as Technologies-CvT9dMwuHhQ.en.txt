 MICHEL DEGRAFF: So at the end of the course,  what I've been wanting--  and I think that was achieved for the greater part-- is  to have students become very analytical when it comes  to the use of language, race, religion,  gender, as technologies, technologies  to create hierarchies of power.  But if you think of something that Steven Biko once said,  Biko once said that the most efficient tool of the opressor  is the mind of the oppressed.  So after the students to understand how when you grow up  in a society where there are various hierarchies that  are imposed on that society based on tools,  like how we perceive race, how we perceive language varieties,  how we perceive gender, how we perceive religion,  and we ourselves--  both myself as a faculty of MIT, but also the students,  are students coming from different social groupings--  we bring those hierarchies with us.  And often, it's implicit-- not aware of that.  So at the end of the course, one thing which became clear to me  is that the students became more aware of how  these cultural phenomena and the use of them  and the position of them are used as tools to maintain  those hierarchies.  So what became clear to me is that  towards the end of the course, the students  were indeed very self-conscious of the uses of culture,  of race, of religion, of issues about migration  in creating those walls.  And I think now they have tools that they  can use to break those walls within themselves, but also  within the social groups.
