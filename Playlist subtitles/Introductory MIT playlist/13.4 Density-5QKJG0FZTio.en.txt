 We want to relate the small length, area, or volume element  to delta m, the amount of mass contained within.  In one dimension, this relation is  called the linear density, lambda,  which is delta m over delta l.  For a uniform rod of length L and total mass M,  lambda is equal to M over L. In two dimensions,  the area element contains an amount of mass sigma times  delta A, where sigma has units of mass over area.  Finally, in three dimensions, the volume density rho  connects the small mass, delta m, to the volume, delta V.
