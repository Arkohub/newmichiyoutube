 We will now go through another example to consolidate our  intuition about the content of the law of iterated  expectations and the law of the total variance.  The example is as follows.  We have a class, and that class consists of 30 students  in total who are divided into sections--  the first and the second section.  Let xi be the score of students i, let's say the  final grade in the class.  We consider the following probabilistic experiment.  We pick a student at random, uniformly, so that each  student is equally likely to be picked.  And we define two random variables--  X is a numerical random variable that gives us the  score of the selected student.  So if student i is selected, the value of the random  variable capital X is xi.  And capital Y is defined as the random variable, which is  the section of the selected student, so that y takes  values 1 or 2.  We're given some information.  For the first section, the average of the  student scores is 90.  For the second section, the average of the  student scores is 60.  Given that information, what is the expected value of the  student score?  Well, each student is equally likely to be picked, so has  probability 1 over 30 to be picked.  And this multiplies the score of the student, so this is the  expected value of the random variable of interest.  What is this number?  Well, we need to calculate the sum of the xi's.  The sum of the first 10 xi's is equal to 90 times 10, and  the sum of the xi's in the other section is  equal to 60 times 20.  And we carry out the calculation, and we find that  the answer is 70.  Now let us look at conditional expectations.  If Y is equal to 1, this means that a student from section  one was picked.  And within that section, each student is equally likely to  be picked, so the outcome of this random variable is  equally likely to be any one of these xi's.  Each xi gets picked with probability of 1 over 10.  And so, the expected value of this random variable is 90.  Similarly for the second section, the expected value of  the score of a randomly selected student, given that  the student belongs in that section, is equal to 60.  With this information available, now we can describe  the abstract conditional expectation,  which is a random variable.  This random variable takes the value of 90 if a student from  the first section was picked, and the value of 60 if a  student from the second section was picked.  What is the probability of this event that the student  from the first section was picked?  Given that the first section has 10 out of a total of 30  students, this probability is 1/3, and therefore, this  probability is 2/3.  Now that we have the distribution of this random  variable, we can calculate the expected value of this random  variable, which is 1/3 times 90 plus 2/3 times 60.  And this number evaluates to 70, which of course, it's no  coincidence, it's the same as the average  over the entire class.  By the law of iterated expectations, we know that  this quantity should be the same as this quantity.  So the law of iterated expectations allows us to  calculate the overall average in the entire class by taking  the section averages, and weigh them according to the  sizes of the different sections.  It's a divide and conquer method, and it is similar to  what we have been doing when we use the total expectation  theorem to divide and conquer.  We continue with our example, and here is a summary of what  we found so far.  The conditional expectation is a random variable that takes  these two values with certain probabilities.  And the mean of this random variable is equal to 70.  Let us now calculate the variance  of this random variable.  This random variable, with probability 1/3, takes a value  90, which is this much away from the mean of this random  variable, which we square.  And with probability 2/3, it takes a value of 60, which is  this much away from the mean of the random variable.  We square this, as well.  And when we carry out the calculation, we find that this  number is equal to 200.  Let us now continue.  And suppose that somebody gave us this piece of information.  For the first section, this is the deviation of the i-th  student from the mean of that section.  So this is the sum of the squares of the deviations and  then we average over all the students.  We will use this data to calculate certain quantities--  for example, the variance of the scores  in the first section.  Now in the first section, with probability 1/10, we pick the  ith student that has this score.  And this is the deviation of that student from the mean of  that section.  So this is the same as the mean squared deviation from  the mean of the section.  And this is exactly the variance within that section.  It is the variance of the random variable, which is the  score of a random student, given that we are selecting a  student from the first section.  For the second section, the story similar.  We're given this information, and this tells us the variance  of the student scores within the second section.  So now we can describe the abstract conditional variance.  It is a random variable that takes this value with  probability equal to the probability of selecting  someone from this section, which is 1/3.  Or it takes a value of 20, which is the variance in the  second section.  And the second section is selected with probability 2/3.  With this information at hand, now we can calculate the  expected value of this random variable, which is 1/3 times  10 plus 2/3 times 20, which is 50/3.  At this point, we have the two quantities that are necessary  to apply the law of total variance.  According to the law of total variance, the variance of the  student scores throughout the entire class is equal to this  number, which is 50/3, plus this number, which is 200.  And this is the overall variance.  Now let us interpret the law of total  variance in this context.  The interpretation is as follows.  The variance of the student scores in the entire class  consists of two pieces.  The first piece looks at the variance inside each section,  which is 10 or 20, depending on which section  we're looking at.  And we take the average over the different sections.  So we look at the variability of the scores within a typical  section, and then we average over all the sections.  The other term looks at the means in the different  sections, and figures out how different are these means.  How much do they vary from the overall class average?  It measures the variability between different sections.  So the overall randomness in the test scores can be broken  down into two pieces of randomness.  One source of randomness is that the different sections  have different means.  The other source of randomness is that inside each section,  the students are different from the  means of their section.  And these two pieces of randomness together add up to  the total randomness of the student scores as measured by  the variance of the entire class.
