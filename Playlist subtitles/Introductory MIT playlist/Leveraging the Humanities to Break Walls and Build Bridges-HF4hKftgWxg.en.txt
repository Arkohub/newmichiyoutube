 PROFESSOR: The humanities, to me, particularly at MIT,  are essential, indispensable, to help break those infamous walls  and build bridges.  Why?  Because the humanities are the only disciplines of philosophy,  psychology, linguistics, history, writing, women  and gender studies, that can give us  the tools to understand how phenomena connected  to race, to language, to religion, to gender,  to sexual orientation, to have the tools to be  able to understand how they can be used  or misused for domination or for liberation.  This is the only group of studies,  of disciplines, that give us those tools.  As Paulo Freire and [INAUDIBLE] said,  we have to learn to become literate.  Not literate just being able to read, but being able to, as we,  as Freire says, to read the world, and read the word.  Because as we read the word, we have  to understand the impact of what we read on the way  the world works.  And the way the world works often  is based on these hierarchies of power that are often  embedded in the text we read.  But we're not able to critically understand those texts  and see how they create a myth, or maintain those hierarchies  of power, then we're going to become  part of these hierarchies We help maintain them.  So the humanities give us the tools  to be critical about these hierarchies  and be able to distance ourselves from them,  and perchance to even undermine those hierarchies,  and create more inclusive, and more--  kinder, more humane societies.
