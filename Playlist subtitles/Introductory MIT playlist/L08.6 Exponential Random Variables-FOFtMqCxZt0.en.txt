 We now introduce a new of random variable, the  exponential random variable.  It has a probability density function that is determined by  a single parameter lambda, which is a positive number.  And the form of the PDF is as shown here.  Note that the PDF is equal to 0 when x is negative, which  means that negative values of X will not occur.  They have zero probability.  And so our random variable is a  non-negative random variable.  The shape of the PDF is as shown in this diagram.  It's 0 for negative values, and then for positive values,  it starts off, it starts off at a value equal to lambda.  This is because if you plug in x equal to 0 in this  expression, you get lambda times e to the 0, which leaves  you just with lambda.  So it starts off with lambda, and then it decays  at the rate of lambda.  Notice that when lambda is small, the initial value of  the PDF is small.  But then the decay rate is also small, so that the PDF  extends over a large range of x's.  On the other hand, when lambda is large, then the PDF starts  large, so there's a fair amount of probability in the  vicinity of 0.  But then it decays pretty fast, so there's much less  probability for larger values of x.  Another observation to make is that the shape of this  exponential PDF is quite similar to the shape of the  geometric PDF that we have seen before, the only  difference being that here we have a discrete distribution,  but here we have a continuous analog of that distribution.  Let's now carry out a calculation.  Let us fix some positive number a, and let us calculate  the probability that our random variable takes a value  larger than or equal to a.  So what we're trying to do is to calculate the probability  that the random variable falls inside this  interval from a to infinity.  Whenever we have a PDF, we can calculate the probability of  falling inside an interval by integrating over that interval  the value of the PDF.  Therefore, we have to calculate  this particular integral.  And at this point, we can recall a fact from calculus,  namely that the integral of the function e to the ax is 1  over a times e to the ax.  We can use this fact by making the correspondence between a  and minus lambda.  And using this correspondence, we can now continue the  calculation of our integral.  We have a factor of lambda.  And then a factor of 1 over a, where a  stands for minus lambda.  So we get the minus 1 over lambda.  And then the same exponential function, e to the  minus lambda x.  And because the range of integration is from a to  infinity, we need to evaluate the integral at a and infinity  and take the difference.  Now, this lambda cancels that lambda.  We're left with a minus sign.  And from the upper limit, we get e to the minus lambda  times infinity.  And then from the second term, we have a minus sign that  cancels with that minus sign and gives us a plus term, plus  e to the minus lambda a.  Now, e to the minus infinity is 0.  And so we're left just with the last term.  And the answer is e to the minus lambda a.  So this gives us the tail probability for an exponential  random variable.  It tells us that the probability of falling higher  than a certain number falls off exponentially with that  certain number.  An interesting additional observation--  if we let a equal to 0 in this calculation, we obtain the  integral of the PDF over the entire range of x's.  And in that case, this probability becomes e to the  minus lambda 0, which is equal to 1.  So we have indeed verified that the integral of this PDF  is equal to 1, as it should be.  Now, let's move to the calculation of the expected  value of this random variable.  We can use the definition.  Since the PDF is non-zero only for positive values of x, we  only need to integrate from 0 to infinity.  We integrate x times the PDF.  And this is an integral that you may have encountered at  some point before.  It is evaluated by using integration by parts.  And the final answer turns out to be 1 over lambda.  Regarding the calculation of the expected value of the  square of the random variable, we need to write down a  similar integral, except that now we  will have here x squared.  This is just another integration by parts, only a  little more tedious.  And the answer turns out to be 2 over lambda squared.  Finally, to calculate the variance, we use the handy  formula that we have.  And the expected value of X squared is this term.  The expected value of X is this term.  When we square it, it becomes similar to this term, but we  have here a 2.  There we have a 1.  And so we're left with just 1 over lambda squared.  And this is the variance of the  exponential random variable.  Notice that when lambda is small, the PDF, as we  discussed before, falls off very slowly, which means that  large x's are also quite possible.  And so the average of this random variable will be on the  higher side.  The PDF extends over a large range, and that translates  into having a large mean.  And because when that happens, the PDF actually spreads, the  variance also increases.  And this is reflected in this formula for the variance.  The exponential random variable is, in many ways,  similar to the geometric.  For example, the expression for the mean, which is 1 over  lambda, can be contrasted with the expression for the mean of  the geometric, which is 1 over p.  And the relationship between these two distributions, the  discrete and the continuous analog, is a theme that we  will revisit several times.  At this point, let me just say that the exponential random  variable is used to model many important  and real world phenomena.  Generally, it models the time that we have to wait until  something happens.  In the discrete case, the geometric random variable  models the time until we see a success for the first time.  In the continuous case, an exponential can be used to  model the time until a customer arrives, the time  until a light bulb burns out, the time until a machine  breaks down, the time until you receive an email, or maybe  the time until a meteorite falls on your house.
