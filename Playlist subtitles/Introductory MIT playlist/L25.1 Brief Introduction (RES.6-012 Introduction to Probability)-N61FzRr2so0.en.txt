 In this lecture, we will concentrate  on the study of Markov chains in the long run,  and study under what conditions a Markov chain  exhibits steady-state behavior, and under what conditions  such steady-state behavior is independent  of the initial starting state.  More precisely, we will look at long-term state occupancy  behavior-- that is, in the n-step transition probabilities  when n is large.  So assume that we have a Markov chain which is initially  in a given state i, and consider the probability  that the chain is in a specific state j after n transitions.  Question-- does that probability converge to some constant  when n goes to infinity?  And if this is the case-- second question-- can this constant be  independent of the initial state i?  We will see that for nice Markov chains,  the answers to both questions will be yes.  How to characterize nice Markov chains?  We will use several new concepts, one dealing  with a Markov chain being aperiodic or not,  and the other with the notion of recurrent classes.  Without going into details now, let  us simply mention that we will show  that the existence of convergence  will be tied to having an aperiodic Markov chain.  And in case we have convergence, the independence  from the initial state will be tied  to having a single recurrent class.  We will end this lecture by looking in detail  at the special and important class of Markov chains usually  known as birth-death processes.
