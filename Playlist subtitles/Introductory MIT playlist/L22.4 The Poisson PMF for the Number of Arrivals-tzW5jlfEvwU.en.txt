 The definition of the Poisson process  gives us information about the probability  that we get k arrivals during an interval of length delta  when delta is a very small number.  How can we find the probability of k arrivals  during an interval of some general length tau,  where tau is no longer a small number?  In particular, we're interested in the random variable denoted  N sub tau, which stands for the number of arrivals  during an interval of length tau.  And we wish to find the PMF of this random variable,  the probability that N sub tau is equal to k,  and which is what we have been denoting  by this particular notation in the context of the Poisson  process.  Now if, instead of the Poisson model,  we had for the Bernoulli process model,  we would know the answer.  S, the number of successes, or number of arrivals in n slots,  has a PMF which is given by the binomial formula.  Can we somehow use what we know about the Bernoulli process  to find the answer for the Poisson process?  The answer is yes, and it involves a limiting argument  of the following kind.  We take the interval from 0 to t and divide it  into a very large number of intervals, so many of them,  where each one of the intervals has a length of delta,  where delta is a small number.  And to push the analogy with the Bernoulli process,  we will be calling those little intervals as slots.  Now during each slot, we may get zero arrivals, one arrival,  but there's also the possibility that there  may be two arrivals, or even more than two arrivals,  happening during one of the slots.  Because of this, the picture that we have here  is not quite the same as for the Bernoulli process  because in the Bernoulli process, each one of the slots  will get only 0 or 1.  So the source of the discrepancy between the two models  is that here, a slot may obtain two or more arrivals.  But how likely is this?  Let us look at the probability that some slot, that  is, any one of the slots, contains two or more arrivals.  That is, we're dealing with the union of the events  that slot i has two or more arrivals.  This event is the union of these events  and, therefore, the probability of this event is less than  or equal than the sum of the probabilities  of the constituents events.  This is an inequality that we have  seen at some point in the past.  And we're calling it to the union bound.  Now what is this summation?  i ranges over the different slots.  And we have tau over delta slots,  so there's so many terms that are being summed.  Now, during any particular slot, the probability  of two or more arrivals is of order delta squared, according  to the definition of the Poisson process.  And this quantity converges to 0 when  we let delta become smaller and smaller.  So this means that the discrepancy between the Poisson  and the Bernoulli model, which was due to the possibility  that we might get two or more arrivals during one  of those slots, this discrepancy is something  that happens with negligible probability.  In other words, the probability that we  get k arrivals in the Poisson model  is approximately the same as the probability  that k slots have an arrival.  Since we're neglecting the possibility  that some slot has two or more arrivals,  this means that the number of arrivals in the Poisson model  will be the same as the number of slots that get an arrival.  This approximate equality becomes more and more exact  as we let delta go to zero.  But now what is this quantity?  The probability that k slots have an arrival  is something that we can calculate  using the binomial probabilities.  Each one of the slots has a certain probability  of having an arrival.  And different slots are independent of each other  by the defining properties of the Poisson process.  Therefore, this approximation that we have developed  satisfies the properties of the Bernoulli process.  We have a certain probability that each slot gets an arrival.  And we have independence across slots.  This means that we can use now the PMF that's  associated with the Bernoulli model  to calculate this quantity and then take the limit,  as delta goes to 0, to obtain a formula for the PMF  for the Poisson process.  In more detail, what we have is the number  of arrivals, which is approximately  the same as the number of slots that have an arrival, obeys  a binomial distribution in the limit as delta  goes to 0-- a binomial distribution in which  the probability of arrival during each one of the slots  is approximately lambda delta and the number of slots  goes to infinity.  And this happens in a way so that the product of the two,  n times p, is equal to-- this term times  this term gives us a lambda times tau.  This term times this term gives us  something that's order of delta.  So it's negligible.  So we have this equality, and so this  is approximately lambda tau with the approximation  becoming more and more exact as we let delta go to zero.  So all we need to do is to take the formula for the Bernoulli  process.  Use these values of p and n and take the limit.  But this is a problem that we have already encountered  and have analyzed.  If we let n go to infinity, p goes to 0  so that their product stays constant,  we have shown that the binomial PMF converges  to the so-called Poisson PMF that takes this form.  Notice one small difference-- n times  p here is equal to lambda, whereas here, n times  p is equal to lambda t.  This means that we need to apply this formula,  but with lambda replaced by lambda t,  and this gives us the final answer.  This is the probability of k arrivals during a time interval  of lenght t in the Poisson process.  And this is a so-called Poisson PMF with parameter lambda tau.  To summarize, our strategy was to argue that the Poisson  process is increasingly accurately described  by a Bernoulli process if we discretize  time in a very fine discretization.  And the approximation becomes exact in the limit  when the discretization is very fine.  So we took the corresponding binomial formula  for the Bernoulli process and took the limit  to that's associated with the parameters  that we would obtain if we have a very fine discretization.  And this gave us the final formula.
