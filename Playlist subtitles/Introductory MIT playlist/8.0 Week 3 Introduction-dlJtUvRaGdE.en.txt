 This week, we will consider the special case  of circular motion.  The case where we know that the motion is exactly constrained  to have a circular geometry.  This will consist of two parts.  First, we will consider the kinematics of circular motion.  How do we describe the trajectory, velocity,  and acceleration of a particle undergoing circular motion?  We will consider both the simple case  of uniform circular motion, where the object moves  with constant speed, and also nonuniform circular motion,  where the object is speeding up and/or slowing down  as a function of time.  We will see that a Cartesian coordinate  system proves awkward for describing circular motion.  And instead, we will introduce the so-called polar coordinate  system in terms of the radius vector  from the origin and its position angle, which  provides a much more elegant description  for circular motion.  We will then examine the dynamics of circular motion  using Newton's second law to understand what sorts of forces  are required in order to cause circular motion in both  the uniform and nonuniform cases.  This will be the first of several examples  we will see in this course of constrained motion.  In this case, the constraint is that the object  moves in a circular path.
