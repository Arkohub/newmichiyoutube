 We will now consider an operation  that is, in some sense, the opposite of merging.  We have a node, and traffic arrives to that node.  And each time that we have an arrival, we flip a coin.  And with probability q, we send that arrival  to one particular stream.  And with probability 1 minus q, we  send the arrival to another stream.  So we get two streams that are formed  by taking the original stream and splitting it  into two pieces.  And as an example, these might be  arrivals at a department store.  And one stream corresponds to the people  who go to the clothes section of the department store,  whereas the other stream corresponds to the people that  go to all of the other sections of the store.  So let us now make our model a little more precise.  We have a Bernoulli process, which  is independent across time.  We also use an independent coin flip  to deal with each one of the arrivals.  But we will also make one additional assumption, namely  that the Bernoulli process is also  independent from the process of coin flips.  With this assumption in place, let us now  continue, and let us draw a picture.  We have a Bernoulli process with parameter p,  and arrivals get recorded at certain times.  Each time that there is an arrival, we will flip a coin.  And with probability q, the arrival  will be sent to that stream.  With probability 1 minus q, the arrival  will be sent to the other stream.  So one possible outcome of the experiment  might be this one, where these two arrivals were  sent to this stream and these two arrivals were  sent to the top stream.  And we have these probabilities q and 1 minus q  of sending the arrivals to one or the other stream.  What kind of process is this one?  We argue it is a Bernoulli process.  First, we need to check independence.  Here, the argument is more or less the same as in the case  when we studied the merging of processes.  For example, if we look at two different slots and we ask,  how is the event at that slot and at that slot determined?  Well, what happens in this slot is determined  by whether we had an arrival here  and what happened to the outcome of the coin flip at that time.  What happens in this slot is determined  by whether we had an arrival here  and what happened to the coin flip at that time.  Now, the coin flips are independent  from the original Bernoulli process.  And for either the coin flips or the Bernoulli process,  we have independence across time.  So all of the four random variables involved here  that determine what happens in these two slots  are independent of each other.  So what happens in this slot is a function  of two random variables here, which  are independent from the two random variables that  determined what happens in that slot.  So what happens in these two slots are independent events.  And this argument goes through more generally  when we consider multiple distinct slots.  So this is the argument for the independence  of the different slots in this particular process.  And then during each slot, what happens  is that we will have an arrival if and only  if this process records an arrival, which happens  with probability p, and the corresponding coin  flip happens to send the arrival in this direction, which  happens with probability q.  And so the conclusion is that this process  is a Bernoulli process with parameter p times q.  By a similar argument, the other process that we obtain  will also be Bernoulli but with probability p times 1 minus q.  And a final question-- are these two processes  that we get after the splitting independent of each other?  This is a question that we can answer  by reasoning intuitively.  If I tell you that there was an arrival in this slot,  what can you infer from this?  Well, it tells me that there was an arrival  in the original stream, which was sent here.  But since it was sent in this direction,  it means that it was not sent in the other direction.  And so we do not have an arrival in this slot.  Knowing that we have an arrival here  means that we do not have an arrival there.  So information about one of the streams  gives us information about what happened in the other stream.  And therefore, we do not have independence.  So this is what happens when we split two Bernoulli processes.  And earlier we saw what happens when  we merge two independent Bernoulli processes.  These two operations of merging and splitting  are quite common in constructing more complex models  using Bernoulli processes as the elements of those models.  They are often useful models either in transportation  systems, where you have streams of traffic  that merge or split, also in models of computer networks  or any other kind of queueing system.  And these same operations of merging and splitting  will also show up when we study the continuous time  analog of the Bernoulli process, namely the Poisson process.
