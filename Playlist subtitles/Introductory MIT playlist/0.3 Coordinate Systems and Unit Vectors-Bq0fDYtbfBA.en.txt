 For most of the problems we will be  facing in the next few weeks, we will only  need to work in two dimensions.  We use a 2D coordinate system so we can formally put vectors  on a grid and more easily do these vector operations.  Once we have our axes, the next thing we need are unit vectors.  Unit vectors have a magnitude of 1  and are in a defined direction.  For a normal x, y coordinate system,  we have i hat in the positive x direction and j hat  in the positive y direction.  In Cartesian coordinates, the unit vectors  are the same no matter what point in space we're at.  We can also define a unit vector in the direction  of an arbitrary vector.  The key here is to make sure it has a magnitude of 1.
