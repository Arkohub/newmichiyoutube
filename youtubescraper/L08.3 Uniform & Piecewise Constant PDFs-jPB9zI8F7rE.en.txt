 Let us now give an example of a continuous random variable--  the uniform random variable.  It is patterned after the discrete random variable.  Similar to the discrete case, we will have a range of  possible values.  In the discrete case, these values would be the integers  between a and b.  In the continuous case, any real number between a and b  will be possible.  In the discrete case, these values were equally likely.  In the continuous case, at all points, we have the same  height for the probability density function.  And as a consequence, if we take two intervals that have  the same length, then these two intervals will be assigned  the same probability.  Intuitively, uniform random variables model  the following situation.  We know that the numerical value of the random variable  will be between a and b.  But we know nothing more.  We have no reason to believe that certain locations are  more likely than others.  And in this sense, the uniform random variable models a  situation of complete ignorance.  By the way, since probabilities must add to 1,  the area of this rectangle must be equal to 1.  And therefore, the height of this rectangle has to be 1  over b minus a, so that we have a height of 1  over b minus a.  We have a length of b minus a.  So the product of the two, which is the  area, is equal to 1.  Finally, here's a more general PDF, which  is piecewise constant.  One thing to notice is that this, in particular, tells us  that PDFs do not have to be continuous functions.  They can have discontinuities.  Of course, for this to be a legitimate PDF, the total area  under the curve, which is the sum of the areas of the  rectangles that we have here, must be equal to 1.  With a piecewise constant PDF, we can calculate probabilities  of events fairly easy.  For example, if you wish to find the probability of this  particular interval, which is going to be the area under the  curve, that area really consists of two pieces.  We find the areas of these two rectangles, add them up, and  this gives us the total probability of  this particular interval.  So at this point, our agenda, moving  forward, will be twofold.  First, we will introduce some interesting  continuous random variables.  We just started with the presentation of the uniform  random variable.  And then, we will also go over all of the concepts and  results that we have developed for discrete random variables  and develop them again for their continuous counterparts.
