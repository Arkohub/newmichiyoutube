 In this lecture, we introduce the Poisson process, which is  a continuous time analog of the Bernoulli process.  One way of thinking about it is as follows.  Time is continuous, but conceptually we divide it into  a very large number of slots.  And during each slot, we have a tiny  probability of an arrival.  This probability is proportional to the  length of the slot.  Furthermore, we have an independence assumption for  the different slots.  The Poisson process is a very elegant model of arrival  processes in continuous time.  It models many real-world phenomena.  And it also has a very clean mathematical structure that  allows us to calculate practically  every quantity of interest.  Our development will parallel our analysis of  the Bernoulli process.  For example, we will find the PMF of the number of arrivals  during a time interval and the PDF of the  time of the kth arrival.  We will discuss the memorylessness properties of  the Poisson process.  Similar to the case of the Bernoulli process, this is  just a consequence of the independence assumptions that  we are making.  We will then exploit these independence properties to  argue that the interarrival times are independent  exponential random variables.  And we will conclude with a comprehensive example.
