 This lecture consists of two parts that deal with two  rather different topics.  In the first part, we look into an important special case  of a derived distribution problem.  We start with two independent random variables with known  distributions and wish to find the distribution of their sum.  We will see that for either the discrete or the continuous  case, there is a nice formula that gives us the answer.  We will develop this formula and then we will talk a little  bit about a graphical way of carrying out the  calculations involved.  As we will discuss, this formula also allows us to  establish the very important fact that the sum of two  independent, normal random variables is normal.  In the second part, we introduce the covariance of  two random variables and the correlation coefficient.  These are certain quantities that allow us to quantify the  degree to which two dependent random variables are related.  For example, a high value of the correlation coefficient  will indicate a strong relation between  these random variables.  We will see the basic mathematical properties of  these quantities and provide some interpretation.  Later on in this class, we will see that they play an  important role in the problem of estimating one random  variable, given the value of another.
