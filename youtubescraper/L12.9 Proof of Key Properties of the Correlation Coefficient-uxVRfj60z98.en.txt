 In this segment, we justify some of the property is that  the correlation coefficient that we  claimed a little earlier.  The most important properties of the correlation coefficient  lies between minus 1 and plus 1.  We will prove this property for the special case where we  have random variables with zero means and unit variances.  So standard deviations are also 1, so most of the terms  here disappear and the correlation coefficient is  simply the expected value of X times Y.  We will show that in this special case the expected  value of X times Y lies between minus 1 and 1.  But the proof of this fact remains valid with a little  bit of more algebra along similar lines  for the general case.  What we will do is we will consider this quantity here  and expand this quadratic and write it as  expected value of X squared.  Then there's a cross term, which is minus 2 rho, the  expected value of X times Y, plus rho squared, expected  value of Y squared.  Now since we assume that the random variables have 0 mean,  this is the same as the variance and we assume that  the variance is 1, so this term here is equal to 1.  Now, the expected value of X times Y is the same as the  correlation coefficient in this case.  So we have minus 2 rho squared and from  here we have rho squared.  And by the previous argument, again this quantity, according  to our assumptions, is equal to 1 so we're left with this  expression, which is 1 minus rho squared.  Now, notice that this is the expectation of a non-negative  random variable so this quantity here must be  non-negative.  Therefore, 1 minus rho squared is non-negative, which means  that rho squared is less than or equal to 1.  And that's the same as requiring that rho lie between  minus 1 and plus 1.  And so we have established this important property, at  least for the special case of 0 means and unit variances.  But as I mentioned, it remains valid more generally.  Now let us look at an extreme case, when the absolute value  of rho is equal to 1.  What happens in this case?  In that case, this term is 0 and this implies that the  expected value of the square of this random variable is  equal to 0.  Now here we have a non-negative random variable,  and its expected value is 0, which means that when we  calculate the expected value of this there will be no  positive contributions and so the only contributions must be  equal to 0.  This means that X minus rho Y has to be equal to 0 with  probability 1.  So X is going to be equal to rho times Y and this will  happen with essential certainty.  Now also because the absolute value overall is equal to 1,  this means that we have either X equal to Y or X equals to  minus Y, in case rho is equal to minus 1.  So we see that if the correlation coefficient has an  absolute value of 1, then X and Y are related to each  other according to a simple linear relation, and it's an  extreme form of dependence between  the two random variables.
