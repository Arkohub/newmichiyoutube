 The definition of the  conditional PDF is very simple.  It is just this formula, which is analogous to the one for  the discrete case.  In all respects--  mathematical and intuitive--  it is very similar to the conditional PMF.  Even so, developing a solid grasp of this concept does  take some further thinking, so we will now make some  observations that should be helpful in this respect.  The first and obvious observation is that the  conditional PDF is non-negative.  It's defined when the denominator is positive, the  numerator is a non-negative quantity, so it's always a  non-negative quantity.  A more interesting observation is that for any given value of  little y, the conditional PDF looks like a slice  of the joint PDF.  Indeed, if you fix the value of little y, then the  denominator in this definition is a constant, and we have a  function that varies with x the same way that the joint  PDF varies with x.  Pictorially, let us consider this particular joint PDF, and  let this be the x-axis and let that be the y-axis.  If we fix a certain value of y, if we condition on Y having  taken this particular value so that our universe is now this  particular line, on that universe the value of the  denominator in this definition is a constant, and the  conditional PDF is going to vary according to the height  of the joint on that  particular conditional universe.  So the height of the joint, if we trace it, is one of those  curves up here, and [then]  goes down.  So it is really a slice taken out of the joint PDF.  If we condition on a different y, we get a different slice of  the joint PDF, and so on.  Actually, the conditional is not exactly  the same as the slice.  We also have this term on the denominator that serves as a  scaling factor.  It turns out that this scaling factor is exactly what we need  for the conditional PDF, given a specific value of little y,  to integrate to 1.  Indeed, if we fix little y and take the integral over all  x's, using the definition, and because this term is a  constant and does not involve x, we only need to integrate  the numerator.  And we recognize that the numerator corresponds to our  earlier formula for the marginal distribution--  the marginal PDF of Y. From the joint, this is how we  recover the marginal PDF of Y.  So the numerator turns out to be the same as the  denominator, and so we get a ratio 1.  Therefore, the conditional PDF for a given value of the  random variable Y behaves in all respects  like an ordinary PDF.  It is non-negative and it integrates to 1.  A last observation is that we can take this definition and  move the denominator to the other side to obtain this  formula, which has the familiar form of the  multiplication rule.  The probability of two events happening is the probability  of the first times the probability of the second  given the first, except that here we're not really dealing  with probabilities, we're dealing with densities.  By symmetry, a similar formula must also be true when we  interchange the roles of X and Y. So, algebraically,  everything is similar to what we have seen for the case of  discrete random variables.  It's the same form of the multiplication rule, although  the interpretation is a bit different because densities  are not probabilities.
