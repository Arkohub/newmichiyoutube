 Here is a simple application of the law of iterated  expectations.  We revisit the stick-breaking example, which we have seen  sometime in the past.  So in this example, we start with a stick that has a  certain length and which we break at a point that's chosen  uniformly at random throughout the length of the stick.  And we call the point at which we cut the stick capital Y.  So the random variable Y has a uniform distribution on the  interval from 0 to l, and is described by  this particular PDF.  Then we take the piece of the stick that's left and we break  it at a point that's chosen uniformly over the length of  the stick that's left.  So the stick that was left has a length Y, and the place at  which we cut it, X, is chosen uniformly over that interval.  So in particular, X-- or rather the conditional  distribution of X given Y--  is uniform on that interval.  So in this example, what is the expected value of X if I  tell you the value of Y?  Well, given the value of Y, the random variable X is  uniform on that range.  So the expected value is going to be at the midpoint that is  equal to y over 2.  This is an equality between numbers.  For any particular number, little y,  we have this equality.  Now let us convert this concrete equality between  numbers to a more abstract equality  between random variables.  This object is a random variable that takes this value  whenever capital Y is little y.  So this is an object that takes the value little y over  2 whenever the random variable capital Y happens  to be little y.  But that's the same as the random variable  capital Y over 2.  This is a random variable that takes this value whenever  capital Y happens to be the same as little y.  So the conditional expectation--  the abstract conditional expectation is a random  variable because its value is determined by the random  variable capital Y, and it is this particular function of  the random variable capital Y.  And now we can proceed and calculate the expected value  of X using the law of iterated expectations.  The law of iterated expectations takes this form.  We have already calculated what this random variable is.  It is the random variable that's equal to Y over 2.  So this is the same as 1/2 the expected value of Y. And since  Y is uniform in the range from 0 to l, the expected value of  Y is equal to l over 2, which gives us an  answer of l over 4.  This is the same as the answer that we got in the past where  we actually found it using the total expectation theorem.  The calculations were exactly the same as what went on here  except that here we carry out the calculation in a more  abstract form.  And what is important to appreciate from this example  is the distinction between these two lines.  This is an equality between numbers, which is true for any  specific little y.  Whereas this is an equality between random variables.  This quantity is random and this quantity is also random,  meaning that their values are not known until the experiment  is carried out and the specific value of  capital Y is realized.
