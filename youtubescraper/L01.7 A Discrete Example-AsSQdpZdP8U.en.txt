 Let us now move from the abstract to the concrete.  Recall the example that we discussed earlier where we  have two rolls of a tetrahedral die.  So there are 16 possible outcomes  illustrated in this diagram.  To continue, now we need to specify a probability law,  some kind of probability assignment.  To keep things simple, we're going to make the assumption  that the 16 possible outcomes are all equally likely.  And each outcome has a probability of 1 over 16.  Given this assumption, we will now proceed to calculate  certain probabilities.  Let us look first at the probability that X, which  stands the result of the first roll, is equal to 1.  The way to calculate this probability is to identify  what exactly that event is in our picture of the sample  space, and then calculate.  The event that X is equal to 1 can happen in four different  ways that correspond to these four particular outcomes.  Each one of these outcomes has a probability of 1 over 16.  The probability of this event is the sum of the  probabilities of the outcomes that it contains.  So it is 4 times 1 over 16, equal to one fourth.  Let now Z stand for the smaller of the two numbers  that came up in our two rolls.  So for example, if X is 2 and Y is equal to 3, then Z is  equal to 2, which is the smaller of the two.  Let us try to calculate the probability that the smaller  of the two outcomes is equal to 4.  Now for the smaller of the two outcomes to be equal to 4, we  must have that both X and Y are equal to 4.  So this outcome here is the only way that this particular  event can happen.  Since there's only one outcome that makes the event happen,  the probability of this event is the probability of that  outcome and is equal to 1 over 16.  For another example, let's calculate the probability that  the minimum is equal to 2.  What does it mean that the minimum is equal to 2?  It means that one of the dice resulted in a 2, and the other  die resulted in a number that's 2 or larger.  So we could have both equal to 2.  We could have X equal to 2, but Y larger.  Or we could have Y equal to 2 and X something larger.  This green event, this green set, is the set of all  outcomes for which the minimum of the two  rolls is equal to 2.  There's a total of five such outcomes.  Each one of them has probably 1 over 16.  And we have discussed that for finite sets, the probability  of a finite set is the sum of the probabilities of the  elements of that set.  So we have five elements here, each one with  probability 1 over 16.  And this is the answer to this problem.  This particular example that we saw here is a special case  of what is called a discrete uniform law.  In a discrete uniform law, we have a sample  space which is finite.  And it has n elements.  And we assume that these n elements are equally likely.  Now since the probability of omega, the probability of the  entire sample space, is equal to 1, this means that each one  of these elements must have probability 1 over n.  That's the only way that the sum of the probabilities of  the different outcomes would be equal to 1 as required by  the normalization axiom.  Consider now some subset of the sample space, an event A  that, exactly k elements.  What is the probability of the set A?  It's the sum of the probabilities of its elements.  There are k elements.  And each one of them has a probability of 1 over n.  And this way we can find the probability of the set A.  So when we have a discrete uniform probability law, we  can calculate probabilities by simply counting the number of  elements of omega, which is n, finding the number n, and  counting the number of elements of the set A. That's  the reason why counting will turn out to be  an important skill.  And there will be a whole lecture devoted to this  particular topic.
