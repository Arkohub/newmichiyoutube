 We now want to introduce some examples of random variables,  and we will start with the simplest  conceivable random variable--  a random variable that takes the values of 0 or 1, with  certain given probabilities.  Such a random variable is called a  Bernoulli random variable.  And the distribution of this random variable is determined  by this parameter p, which is a given number that lies in  the interval between 0 and 1.  Using PMF notation, we have the probability of 0 being  equal to 1 minus p and the probability of taking the  value 1 equal to p.  If you wish to plot this particular PMF, the plot is  rather simple.  It consists of two bars, one at 0 and one at 1.  This one has a height of p and this has a  height of 1 minus p.  Bernoulli random variables show up whenever you're trying  to model a situation where you run a trial.  And that trial can result in two alternative outcomes,  either success or failure, or heads versus tails, and so on.  Another situation where Bernoulli random variables  show up is when we're making a connection between events and  random variables.  Here's how this connection is made.  We have our sample space, omega.  And within that sample space, we have a certain event, A.  And outside of the event A, of course, we have the complement  of A.  Our random variable is defined so that it takes a value of 1,  whenever the outcome of the experiment lies in A. And it  takes a value of 0 whenever the outcome of the experiment  lies outside the event A, so that it lies in the  complement.  This random variable is called the indicator random variable  of the event A. It is equal to 1 if and  only if event A occurs.  And the PMF of that random variable  can be found as follows.  This is PMF notation.  This is the equivalent probabilistic notation.  This is the probability that the random variable  takes a value 1.  Now the random variable takes the value of 1 if and only if  event A occurs.  And so what we have is that our random variable, the  indicator random variable, is a Bernoulli random variable  with a parameter p equal to the probability of the event  of interest.  Indicator random variables are very useful because they allow  us to translate a manipulation of events to a manipulation of  random variables.  And sometimes the algebra of working with random variable  is easier than working with events, as we will see in some  later examples.
