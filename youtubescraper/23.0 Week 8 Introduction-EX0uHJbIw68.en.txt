 This week, we will continue our discussion of energy.  We will introduce the concept of potential energy--  which is related to the work done by a conservative force,  and also the concept of total mechanical energy--  which is defined as the sum of the kinetic and potential  energies.  We will demonstrate that the total mechanical energy  of a system remains constant if only conservative forces are  acting.  This is known as the Principle of Conservation  of Mechanical Energy.  We will also see how the work done  by any non-conservative forces causes  the total mechanical energy of the system  to change, usually causing mechanical energy to be  lost from the system.  Finally, we will see how graphs of a system's potential energy,  as a function of position, provide  an elegant way of understanding the behavior  of the system for a given value of the total mechanical energy.
