 Probability models often involve infinite sample  spaces, that is, infinite sets.  But not all sets are of the same kind.  Some sets are discrete and we call them countable, and some  are continuous and we call them uncountable.  But what exactly is the difference between these two  types of sets?  How can we define it precisely?  Well, let us start by first giving a definition of what it  means to have a countable set.  A set will be called countable if its elements can be put  into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the positive integers.  This means that we look at the elements of that set, and we  take one element-- we call it the first element.  We take another element-- we call it the second.  Another, we call the third element, and so on.  And this way we will eventually exhaust all of the  elements of the set, so that each one of those elements  corresponds to a particular positive integer, namely the  index that appears underneath.  More formally, what's happening is that we take  elements of that set that are arranged in a sequence.  We look at the set, which is the entire range of values of  that sequence, and we want that sequence to exhaust the  entire set omega.  Or in other words, in simpler terms, we want to be able to  arrange all of the elements of omega in a sequence.  So what are some examples of countable sets?  In a trivial sense, the positive integers themselves  are countable, because we can arrange them in a sequence.  This is almost tautological, by the definition.  For a more interesting example, let's look at the set  of all integers.  Can we arrange them in a sequence?  Yes, we can, and we can do it in this manner, where we  alternate between positive and negative numbers.  And this way, we're going to cover all of the integers, and  we have arranged them in a sequence.  How about the set of all pairs of positive integers?  This is less clear.  Let us look at this picture.  This is the set of all pairs of positive integers, which we  understand to continue indefinitely.  Can we arrange this sets in a sequence?  It turns out that we can.  And we can do it by tracing a path of this kind.  So you can probably get the sense of how  this path is going.  And by continuing this way, over and over, we're going to  cover the entire set of all pairs of positive integers.  So we have managed to arrange them in a sequence.  So the set of all such pairs is indeed a countable set.  And the same argument can be extended to argue for the set  of all triples of positive integers, or the set of all  quadruples of positive integers, and so on.  This is actually not just a trivial mathematical point  that we discuss for some curious reason, but it is  because we will often have sample spaces  that are of this kind.  And it's important to know that they're countable.  Now for a more subtle example.  Let us look at all rational numbers within the range  between 0 and 1.  What do we mean by rational numbers?  We mean those numbers that can be expressed as a  ratio of two integers.  It turns out that we can arrange them in a sequence,  and we can do it as follows.  Let us first look at rational numbers that have a  denominator term of 2.  Then, look at the rational numbers that have a  denominator term of 3.  Then, look at the rational numbers, always within this  range of interest, that have a denominator of 4.  And then we continue similarly--  rational numbers that have a denominator of 5, and so on.  This way, we're going to exhaust all of  the rational numbers.  Actually, this number here already appeared there.  It's the same number.  So we do not need to include this in a sequence, but that's  not an issue.  Whenever we see a rational number that has already been  encountered before, we just delete it.  In the end, we end up with a sequence that goes over all of  the possible rational numbers.  And so we conclude that the set of all rational numbers is  itself a countable set.  So what kind of set would be uncountable?  An uncountable set, by definition, is a set that is  not countable.  And there are examples of uncountable sets, most  prominent, continuous subsets of the real line.  Whenever we have an interval, the unit interval, or any  other interval that has positive length, that interval  is an uncountable set.  And the same is true if, instead of an interval, we  look at the entire real line, or we look at the  two-dimensional plane, or three-dimensional  space, and so on.  So all the usual sets that we think of as continuous sets  turn out to be uncountable.  How do we know that they are uncountable?  There is actually a brilliant argument that establishes that  the unit interval is uncountable.  And then the argument is easily extended to other  cases, like the reals and the plane.  We do not need to know how this argument goes, for the  purposes of this course.  But just because it is so beautiful, we will actually be  presenting it to you.
