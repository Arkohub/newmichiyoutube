 We already showed that the torque about a point  can also be thought of as a decomposition.  We take the vector from the point P to the center of mass  and apply all the forces acting on the particle  at the center of mass.  And we can calculate the torque about the center  of mass due to the action of some forces  where we're having forces acting about the center of mass.  Now if we choose the point P to equal the center of mass,  then we know that the vector r center of mass  to the center of mass is 0.  So the torque about the center of mass  is just equal to the forces about that point.  We know that torque is always just Lcm/dt.  Now, again, how could we justify that statement  that because we're only calculating  the torque about the center of mass,  it's only the rotational angular momentum about the center  of mass that's changing.  We saw before that if we thought of Lp, again,  as a translational and a rotational angular momentum--  I'm sorry, rotational angular momentum, omega--  and the point p was equal to the center of mass,  then this first piece would be 0.  And L about p is only Icm omega and dLp/dt  is equal to Icm alpha for a fixed axis.  And that's exactly equal to dLcm/dt.  And so the point here is that when  we're applying problems involving rotation  and translation, we can just analyze the torque  about the center of mass and only consider  how the angular momentum about the center of mass is changing.  And then for the center of mass motion--  so this gives us our rotational dynamics.  And for our linear dynamics, we will still  apply F equals the total mass times Acm.  So that's our linear dynamics.  And this is our overall decomposition  of rotational motion.  To analyze it, we study the rotational dynamics  and the linear dynamics.
