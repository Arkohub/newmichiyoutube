ANA BELL: This is my definition, including the method  to paint the car, so to change its color.  And the question says you create a car with this line here.  So you're initializing it with 4 comma 2.  What's a line of code that changes the color from whatever  it initially is to red?  The first one, car.paintred, is sort  of attempting to do the way that we  saw in the right in the slides where  you calling the class name dot.  But it's missing the self.  So we don't know what object to call it on.  So that one's out of the running.  The second one is closer, but we have red here as  a variable as opposed to a string.  So that one's not going to work.  The third one looks good.  And the fourth one is just weird.  I don't think that one will work.  It's attempting to put a value for self.  But you've already called mycar dot instead of the class name  dot.  So here, this isn't going to work.  So since you already called the object name dot method name,  you just have to give it the other parameter that it needs,  which is the color.  I think the majority have gotten it right.
