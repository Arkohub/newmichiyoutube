 For those of you who are curious, we will go through an  argument that establishes that the set of real numbers is an  uncountable set.  It's a famous argument known as Cantor's  diagonalization argument.  Actually, instead of looking at the set of all real  numbers, we will first look at the set of all numbers, x,  that belong to the open unit interval--  so numbers between 0 and 1--  and such that their decimal expansion involves  only threes and fours.  Now, the choice of three and four is somewhat arbitrary.  It doesn't matter.  What really matters is that we do not have  long strings of nines.  So suppose that this set was countable.  If the set was countable, then that set could be written as  equal to a set of this form, x1, x2, x3 and so on, where  each one of these is a real number inside that set.  Now, suppose that this is the case.  Let us take those numbers and write them  down in decimal notation.  For example, one number could be this one, and  it continues forever.  Since we're talking about real numbers, their decimal  expansion will go on forever.  Suppose that the second number is of this kind, and it has  its own decimal expansion.  Suppose that the third number is, again, with some decimal  expansion and so on.  So we have assumed that our set is countable and  therefore, the set is equal to that sequence.  So this sequence exhausts all the numbers in that set.  Can it do that?  Let's construct a new number in the following fashion.  The new number looks at this digit and  does something different.  Looks at this digit, the second digit of the second  number, and does something different.  Looks at the third digit of the third number and does  something different.  And we continue this way.  This number that we have constructed here is different  from the first number.  They differ in the first digit.  It's different from the second number.  They differ in the second digit.  It's different from the third number because it's different  in the third digit and so on.  So this is a number, and this number is different  from xi for all i.  So we have an element of this set which does not belong to  this sequence.  Therefore, it cannot be true that this set is equal to the  set formed by that sequence.  And so this is a contradiction to the initial assumption that  this set could be written in this form, and this  contradiction establishes that since this is not possible,  that the set that we have here is an uncountable set.  Now, this set is a subset of the set of real numbers.  Since this one is uncountable, it is not hard to show that  the set of real numbers, which is a bigger set, will also be  uncountable.  And so this is this particular famous argument.  We will not need it or make any arguments of this type in  this class, but it's so beautiful that it's worth for  everyone to see it once in their lifetime.
