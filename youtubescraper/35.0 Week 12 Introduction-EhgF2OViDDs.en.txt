 We have previously studied the translational motion  of rigid bodies by analyzing the motion of their center of mass.  We have also studied the rotation of rigid bodies  about a fixed axis.  This week, we will consider more complicated examples  of rigid body motion, where translation and rotation are  both occurring simultaneously.  One example is, if I toss a rigid body through the air  but give it a spin at the same time  so that it tumbles in space as it falls.  A second example is a wheel that is  rolling along a flat surface.  Its location is translating, but at the same time,  it is also spinning about its axis.  A natural way to analyze such motions  is to, once again, take advantage  of [? Chasles' ?] theorem, which states  that one possible way of describing  the general motion of a rigid body  is by a translation of its center of mass  plus a rotation about its center of mass.  This separation of the general case  into two distinct type of motions  will greatly simplify our analysis.  One of the most common examples of simultaneous translational  and rotational motion is that of rolling objects,  and we will concentrate on this particular application.  We will see that an important detail is whether or not  the object rolls without slipping,  and the role that friction can play in each case.  The special case of rolling without slipping  amounts to a constraint condition  that relates the translational speed of the center of mass  to the radius and the rotational angular velocity.
