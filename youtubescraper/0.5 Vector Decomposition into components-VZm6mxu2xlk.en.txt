 Vectors can be represented through their components.  If we have a vector A, we can decompose it  into its components in the x and y-directions  by finding the vectors, one along x and one along y,  that add up to the vector A. This  is the same thing as finding the projections of the vector A  along the x and y-axes.  Here is the projection of the vector  onto the x-axis, its x-component.  And here is the projection onto the y-axis, the y-component.  This particular vector could be written  as A is equal to minus 2i hat plus minus 2j hat.  A generic vector in two dimensions  can be written as A is equal to Ax, the x-component of A,  times i hat, the unit vector along x, plus Ay,  the y-component, times j hat, the unit vector along y.  If the vector is in three dimensions,  we will also have an Az times k hat.  What if we have the vector minus 3i hat plus 2j hat?  First we find the vector minus 3 times vector i hat  and add this to the vector 2 times j hat.  We can draw this vector anywhere.  It doesn't have to start at the origin.
