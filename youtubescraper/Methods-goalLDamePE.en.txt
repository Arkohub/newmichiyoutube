We saw that on the previous slide.  I want to add a method that's going  to change the color of the car, and these are my four choices.

So we know that self has to be the first parameter,  so we can automatically eliminate A and C  and it's between B and D. And remember  I said you have to be conscious about whose data attribute  you're accessing, and in this case,  we want to change the color of a particular instance of the car,  right?  So we have to say self.color instead of just color.  If we just said color, then color  would refer to just a variable inside the class,  not a data attribute of a particular object.
