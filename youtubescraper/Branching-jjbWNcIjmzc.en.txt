ANA BELL: So we have x is going to be whatever number  the user types in, y is going to be whatever number  the user types in.  First thing I'm going to check is if x is equal to y.  So if we type in x is 0 and y is 5, 0 is not equal to 5,  so we're not even going to consider  what's in this code block.  Then we're going to check the next one-- if 0 is  less than 5-- and that's true.  So this is the very first conditional  that evaluates to true, so we're just  going to print x is smaller.  And I think that's what's being dragged down here.  Awesome.
