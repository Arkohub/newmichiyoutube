 We now discuss how to come up with confidence intervals when  we try to estimate the unknown mean of some random variable,  or of some distribution, using the  sample mean as our estimator.  So here X1 up to Xn are independent, identically  distributed random variables that are drawn from a  distribution that has a certain mean theta, the  quantity that we want to estimate, and some variance  sigma squared.  Let us say that we want to construct a  95% confidence interval.  Our starting point will be the fact that the sample mean,  according to the central limit theorem, can be described  approximately using normal distributions.  And we look up at the normal table, and we observe the  following--  that if we take a standard normal random variable, then  there is probability, 97.5% of falling below this number,  1.96, which means that there is probability 2 1/2% of  falling above that number.  And by symmetry, the probability of falling below  minus 1.96 is also 2 1/2%.  This means that this middle interval here has probability  95%, and we exploit this fact as follows.  If we take the sample mean, subtract the true mean, and  then divide by the standard deviation of the sample mean,  then we obtain a random variable, which is  approximately a standard normal.  Therefore, what we have here is the probability of an  approximately standard normal random variable.  Or actually, its absolute value falling below 1.96.  This is just the event that our standard normal falls  inside this middle interval here, according to this entry  from the normal tables and the previous discussion, this  probability is going to be approximately 95%.  And now we take this statement, send this term to  the other side of the inequality, and then interpret  what it means for an absolute value to  be less than something.  And we obtain an equivalent statement.  This event here is algebraically identical to the  event that we have up there, and this provides us with the  desired confidence interval.  We think of this quantity here as the lower end of the  confidence interval.  This quantity here is the upper end of  the confidence interval.  And this statement tells us that there is probability  approximately equal to 95% that the confidence interval  constructed this way contains the true value  of the unknown parameter.  So this is how we obtain a 95% confidence interval.  If instead we wanted a 90% confidence interval, we would  proceed in more or less in the same way.  Here, we would want to have the number 0.95.  Why is that?  We want this middle interval to have probability 90%, which  means that we want to have probability 5% at  each one of the tails.  And then we look up at the normal tables, and we find  that the entry that gives us probability 95% of being below  that value is 1.645.  So if we use 1.645 in place of 1.96, we obtain a 90%  confidence interval, and similarly for other choices.  For example, if we want a 99% confidence interval.  There's only one issue that's left to discuss, and this is  the following.  In order to obtain numerical values for the endpoints of  the confidence interval, we need to know sigma, the  standard deviation of the random  variables that we are observing.  But if we do not know the value of sigma, then we may  have to do some additional work.
