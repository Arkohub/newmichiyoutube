So we have this function is even, same one as before,  except now I'm giving you this implementation.  If n is positive and n divided by 2's remainder is 0,  return true.  So if n is even and positive return true.  The next one, if n is negative and divisible by 2 return true.  OK, so far.  And otherwise return false.  Question being, with that implementation  is this test set n is 4, n is minus 4 path complete?  And the answer is, yes.  Because 4 is a positive number and divisible by 2.  Minus 4 is a negative number and divisible by 2.  And 5 would hit upon the else.  So the answer is actually yes for that first question.  Perfect.  Second question, with that implementation,  which value for n is incorrectly labeled by that program?  Well, n is very large still works, and is very small  still works.  And remember, I said you have to test boundary conditions.  In this case, boundary conditions for this program  being when n is equal to zero.  So I think the orange is n is equal to 0.  Perfect.
