 We now revisit the exponential random variable that we  introduced earlier and develop some intuition about what it  represents.  We do this by establishing a memorylessness property,  similar to the one that we established earlier in the  discrete case for the geometric PMF.  Suppose that it is known that light bulbs have a lifetime  until they burn out, which is an  exponential random variable.  You go to a store, and you are given two choices, to buy a  new light bulb, or to buy a used light bulb that has been  working for some time and has not yet burned out.  Which one should you take?  We want to approach this question mathematically.  So let us denote by capital T the lifetime of the bulb.  So time starts at time 0, and then at some random time that  we denote by capital T, the light bulb will burn out.  And we assume that this random variable is exponential with  some given parameter lambda.  In one of our earlier calculations, we have shown  that the probability that capital T is larger than some  value little x falls exponentially  with that value x.  We are now told that a certain light bulb has already been  operating for t time units without failing.  So we know that the value of the random variable capital T  is larger than little t.  We are interested in how much longer the light bulb will be  operating, and so we look at capital X, which is the  remaining lifetime from the current time until the light  bulb burns out.  So capital X is this particular random variable  here, and it is equal to capital T minus little t.  Let us now calculate the probability that the light  bulb lasts for another little x time units.  That is, that this random variable, capital X, is at  least as large as some little x.  That is, that the light bulb remains alive  until time t plus x.  We use the definition of conditional probabilities to  write this expression as the probability that capital X is  bigger than little x.  On the other hand, capital X is T minus t, so we  write it this way--  T minus t is bigger than little x, and also that T is  bigger than little t, divided by the probability of the  conditioning event.  Just write this event in a cleaner form, capital T being  larger than little t plus x and being larger than little  t, again divided by the probability of the  conditioning event.  And now notice that capital T will be greater than little t  and also greater than little t plus x, that is, capital T is  larger than this number and this number, if and only if it  is larger than this second number here.  So in other words, the intersection of these two  events is just this event here, that capital T is larger  than little t plus x.  Now, we can use the formula for the probability that  capital T is larger than something.  We apply this formula, except that instead of little x, we  have t plus x.  And so here we have e to the minus lambda t plus x divided  by the probability that capital T is bigger than t.  So we use this formula, but with little t in the place of  little x, and we obtain e to the minus lambda t.  We have a cancellation, and we're left with e to the minus  lambda x, which is a final answer in this calculation.  What do we observe here?  The probability that the used light bulb will live for  another x time units is exactly the same as the  corresponding probability that the new light bulb will be  alive for another x time units.  So new and used light bulbs are described by the same  probabilities, and they're probabilistically  identical, the same.  Differently said, the used light bulb does not remember,  and it is not affected by how long it has been running.  And this is the memorylessness property of  exponential random variables.  Let us now build some additional insights on  exponential random variables.  We have a formula for the density, the PDF.  And from this, we can calculate the probability that  T lies in a small interval.  For example, for a small delta, this probability here  is going to be approximately equal to the density of T  evaluated at 0 times delta, which is lambda times e to the  0, which is 1, times delta.  What if we are told that the light bulb has been alive for  t time units?  What is the probability that it burns out during the next  delta times units?  Since a used but still alive light bulb is  probabilistically identical to a new one, this conditional  probability is the same as this probability here that a  new light bulb burns out in the next delta times units.  And so this is also approximately  equal to lambda delta.  So we see that independently of how long a light bulb has  been alive, during the next delta time units it will have  a lambda delta probability of failing.  One way of thinking about this situation is that the time  interval is split into little intervals of length delta.  And as long as the light bulb is alive, if it is alive at  this point, it will have probability lambda delta of  burning out during the next interval of length delta.  This is like flipping a coin.  Once every delta time steps, there is a probability lambda  delta that there is a success in that coin flip, where  success corresponds to having the light bulb actually burn  down, and the exponential random variable corresponds to  the total time elapsed until the first success.  In this sense, the exponential random variable is a close  analog of the geometric random variable, which was the time  until the first success in a discrete time setting.  This analogy turns out to be the foundation behind the  Poisson process that we will be studying  later in this course.
