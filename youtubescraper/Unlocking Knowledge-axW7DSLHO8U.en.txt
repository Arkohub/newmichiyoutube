 MICHEL DEGRAFF: So why was I so happy to engage  in having this course be ported on OpenCourseWare?  Well, first of all, I have a very deep affection  for OpenCourseWare because I feel that OpenCourseWare  has this potential to teach to the billions,  to share knowledge, to unlock knowledge for people  in very far-flung places, very remote places,  like in Haiti where there's little access to quality  materials.  So for me, I feel that OpenCourseWare's mission  is very germane to myself, as a Haitian, [INAUDIBLE] MIT,  wanting to share this wealth that I have intellectually  with the rest of the world, including  my compatriots in Haiti who don't  have that access, that much access, to quality materials.  But also, when it comes to this issue of breaking walls  and building bridges, as we see, say, in the US and parts  of Europe, the world moving to more exclusion, to more walls,  I feel that the kind of knowledge  that we're building here at MIT and how  we as a people, we as a global village, as we enrich ourselves  by understanding other people's experiences, be it Muslims,  and immigrants, and blacks, and Latinos, it is wealth there.  So I feel that it's important to take  this knowledge, these discussions,  and have it shared with the whole world  so people can see that there's a different way of thinking  that doesn't involve building walls for security,  but instead creating dialogues, building bridges, so that we  all can be the richer for it wherever we are,  be it in Boston, Massachusetts, or in Port-au-Prince Haiti,  or in Syria, or even Iran.  So that's why I feel it's important  that such courses be on OpenCourseWare for the world  to participate in.
