 Happy Monday everyone! How you all doing? You&nbsp; know it's good because it's a goodie bag day&nbsp;&nbsp;  and so I'll get to what you have in your hands in&nbsp; this lecture. Today-- So we've been talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;  these things for a while now, right? We've built&nbsp; up an understanding of the stamp and the basis,&nbsp;&nbsp;  and then we understood how to talk about it&nbsp; like in terms of the planes and the symmetries,&nbsp;&nbsp;  and then we shined x-rays on it, and now we're&nbsp; going to start taking them all apart. And so don't&nbsp;&nbsp;  be sad, don't be sad, because actually that's more&nbsp; real-- that's more real. And that's what we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;  talk about today. So what our plan is-- you know--&nbsp; So today we're going to start creating defects&nbsp;&nbsp;  in the perfect order that we've had so far. And&nbsp; in your goody bag you have a defect generation&nbsp;&nbsp;  machine, which we'll talk about. And then on--&nbsp; And so today we're gonna talk about one kind&nbsp;&nbsp;  of defect, that's a point defect, and then&nbsp; on Wednesday we'll talk about line defects,&nbsp;&nbsp;  and then we'll just mess the whole thing up,&nbsp; and we're going to make it amorphous. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp;  where we're going. And beyond that if you&nbsp; want to know more about where we're going,&nbsp;&nbsp;  there's the concept map up there for exam 3.&nbsp; Which again, you know we don't pick these dates,&nbsp;&nbsp;  so this date came later in the semester that&nbsp; we wanted but it's that's what it is. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;  it's all the way up in early December. But--&nbsp; Because of the fact that there's a Thanksgiving&nbsp;&nbsp;  holiday in between and there's one topic here&nbsp; we have to start before the exam. It's not here&nbsp;&nbsp;  because it won't be on the exam but we're going to&nbsp; start polymers but won't be on the exam. I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;  to spend the whole lecture before exam three just&nbsp; reviewing for exam three, because we're gonna have&nbsp;&nbsp;  that Thanksgiving break and all that. So that's&nbsp; what's not listed here these are just the topics&nbsp;&nbsp;  that are covered on exam three. Okay. Good. If&nbsp; anyone has any questions please do let me know.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The concept map. Now the thesis of 3.091&nbsp; you have seen in multiple different ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I have tried to convey to you that&nbsp; the electronic structure of atoms&nbsp;&nbsp;  is the key to life. It's the key to chemistry.&nbsp; It's the key to understanding and within that&nbsp;&nbsp;  you get things like this which is what we've&nbsp; been talking about recently like composition&nbsp;&nbsp;  and arrangement. Right? That's these crystals&nbsp; that's these different-- BCC FCC. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And then the chemistry you put inside. But&nbsp; you see the other thing about it is defects.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Because the thing is that defects, which is the&nbsp; topic of today and Wednesday, they are absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;  crucial for understanding the properties.&nbsp; If they're there and I just told you they're&nbsp;&nbsp;  always there. The question is how much are they&nbsp; there? And so if you don't know about defects--&nbsp;&nbsp;  if you don't know about defects then you&nbsp; really cannot fully understand properties.  There is a very strong correlation between the&nbsp; two and that's why we have to talk about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We have to understand them. Now I love&nbsp; this quote from Colin Humphreys he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Crystals are like people, it is the defects&nbsp; in them which tend to make them interesting."&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yeah. And that's actually really true because&nbsp; defects, right, defects sound you know... 'I&nbsp;&nbsp;  don't want to defect.' No, actually oftentimes&nbsp; you do want defects. Sometimes you don't. So&nbsp;&nbsp;  there are some kinds that are kind of like&nbsp; maybe not things you want in your crystal&nbsp;&nbsp;  and then there are other kinds that actually you&nbsp; are engineering purposefully to be there. Either&nbsp;&nbsp;  way you got to understand them. Right? And that's&nbsp; what we're doing today because --Gesundheit-- so&nbsp;&nbsp;  you know if you take this three layer-- We talk&nbsp; about graphene. It's a one atom thick material.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pretty cool-- every atom's on the surface. Here's&nbsp; another example of what's called a 2D material.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Why? It's not 2D but it's called a 2D material&nbsp; because it gets you like... you know more&nbsp;&nbsp;  publicity on your work. This is molybdenum--&nbsp; this is molybdenum disulfide it's really cool&nbsp;&nbsp;  material. It's three atoms thick. So it's kind of&nbsp; like 2D-ish, right? Yeah but see that's the model.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's the model. This is reality. This is real--&nbsp; How do you see-- How do we see atoms like this?&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's a real picture. Do we use x-rays?&nbsp; No? What do we use to see atoms that well?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Electrons. Electrons are our light, right? That's&nbsp; what we're using. This is an electron picture,&nbsp;&nbsp;  electron. And if you do that you can&nbsp; see individual atoms and look at that&nbsp;&nbsp;  there's there's places where atoms are missing all&nbsp; over the place. That's reality. That's reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And those where you have one atom missing or&nbsp; where you have one thing that is localized and&nbsp;&nbsp;  disruptive to the regularity of the lattice...&nbsp; that's called a point defect. So let's write that&nbsp;&nbsp;  down. That's the one that we're talking about&nbsp; today. So the point defect, 'point defect', is&nbsp;&nbsp;  where you have a localized...&nbsp; localized disruption...&nbsp;&nbsp;  in the regularity, 'regularity'.  The periodicity the repeating of the lattice.  And it could be on or between,&nbsp; we'll see this, on or between&nbsp;&nbsp;  sites. Right? It could be a defect that is, like&nbsp; you see here, there's an actual atom missing. What&nbsp;&nbsp;  could be something that maybe you've got in there&nbsp; in between sites? But either way it's a disruption&nbsp;&nbsp;  that's localized to a point or almost a point.&nbsp; And so it is --Gesundheit-- that you can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;  if we just make these disruptions in something.&nbsp; Alumina. We talk about alumina, right? Remember&nbsp;&nbsp;  alumina's really strong lattice energies? So&nbsp; it's like sandpaper. Oh, it's also toothpaste.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's in a lot of stuff. Alumina is a great--&nbsp; But look at this. That's alumina with almost&nbsp;&nbsp;  no defects. It's still got some. You can never get&nbsp; rid of them all! But here it is when I purposely&nbsp;&nbsp;  engineer the defects in alumina and I put a&nbsp; little titanium or iron. Or here's it when&nbsp;&nbsp;  I put chromium. So you can-- There's one property&nbsp; where the localized disruption, and it's not a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;  as we'll see, the localized disruption changes&nbsp; the properties. That is key. That's just color.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Right? This applies to most properties of&nbsp; materials. And so this first one, the point&nbsp;&nbsp;  defects that we're talking about today, you can&nbsp; kind of think of those as zero dimensional because&nbsp;&nbsp;  they're they're localized. You know. They&nbsp; don't really go off in a line. They don't&nbsp;&nbsp;  go off in a plane or a volume. And you can&nbsp; have defects that are that cover all of those&nbsp;&nbsp;  possibilities. But these are points. Alright?&nbsp; This is what the word localized means here, okay?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay. Now in this class, we're not going to cover&nbsp; all of them, but we will cover these two. Today:&nbsp;&nbsp;  this one. On Wednesday: that one. And that'll&nbsp; give you enough of a sense of the role of defects&nbsp;&nbsp;  and how to think about defects and crystals.&nbsp; Right? So this is how we think and classify&nbsp;&nbsp;  defects. Okay. Now the four-- so now we're&nbsp; going to point defects-- now the four,&nbsp;&nbsp;  there are different types of point defects that&nbsp; can happen. The one that you saw here is a certain&nbsp;&nbsp;  one. That's called a vacancy. It's because there's&nbsp; an atom that's vacant. So you literally just lost&nbsp;&nbsp;  an atom somewhere in there. Okay? Now that's a&nbsp; vacancy and that always exists. But you could also&nbsp;&nbsp;  have taken something like one of the atoms that's&nbsp; already in there, maybe an aluminum or an oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;  that's in the lattice, and you could substitute&nbsp; something in place of that. That's another-- Why&nbsp;&nbsp;  is that a point defect? Because I didn't like&nbsp; tear something out. But no, but you changed the&nbsp;&nbsp;  regularity. Localized disruption and regularity.&nbsp; So if I put something else in for aluminum&nbsp;&nbsp;  that's a point defect. Right? And again, now go&nbsp; back to here. You can see it here. So we classify&nbsp;&nbsp;  these, right? There's a vacancy, which is an atom&nbsp; missing. There's what's called an interstitial,&nbsp;&nbsp;  which is an atom that goes in between the other&nbsp; atoms. Here it's a self interstitial so it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;  same type of atom. And these are-- This is where&nbsp; you have a different type of atom in between and&nbsp;&nbsp;  this is where you have a different type of atom&nbsp; as well. Those are both called impurities and I&nbsp;&nbsp;  will talk about those all today. We're gonna start&nbsp; and focus a lot of our attention on the vacancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And that's what I want you to use this goodie bag&nbsp; to understand, is the vacancies. Okay. Vacancies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Why do vacancies happen? What are vacancies? To&nbsp; understand vacancies in crystals we have to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;  about this guy. And oh... this guy was brilliant.&nbsp; This-- I'm sure you know his name is Svante. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;  it's written right there. Svante Arrhenius.&nbsp; Arrhenius studied in the late 1800s so many&nbsp;&nbsp;  different things and made so many contributions&nbsp; that it's almost hard to catalog. He was&nbsp;&nbsp;  brilliant. And you know he won the nobel prize&nbsp; in chemistry for his work on electrolytes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But he also worked on immunology. He was the very&nbsp; first person in the late 1800s to come up with a&nbsp;&nbsp;  model for global warming and the role of CO2 in&nbsp; the temperature change of the planet. And his&nbsp;&nbsp;  predictions were actually pretty darn good. He&nbsp; was brilliant. And one of the things that he did&nbsp;&nbsp;  is, he observed what it were called activated&nbsp; processes, and how they depended on temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And so we have this equation that I need to&nbsp; talk about today and it's going to come back.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So we're going to talk about this equation,&nbsp; which is the Arrhenius equation, that relates&nbsp;&nbsp;  the rate of some process to the temperature. And&nbsp; the activation energy for that process. So we got&nbsp;&nbsp;  to talk about what all that means, alright? Now&nbsp; we will be using this. Today we're going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;  it to think about concentrations of vacancies in&nbsp; a crystal which follow Arrhenius-like behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Right? But then we're going to come back to it&nbsp; when we go into reaction kinetics in a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;  of weeks. Where we talk about reaction rates. So&nbsp; we'll be using Arrhenius multiple times throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;  the rest of the semester. So what is it? So the&nbsp; Arrhenius-- So the general Arrhenius equation can&nbsp;&nbsp;  be written like this. Arrhenius, he was not in&nbsp; the army but this is just the general equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay. So let's put equation there. And so we have&nbsp; k, which is some rate, equals A. I'll talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;  each of these. Times e the exponential of e to&nbsp; the minus Ea over RT. What are these things?&nbsp;&nbsp;  So this is the general equation for the rate of&nbsp; some process. As we're going to see this applies&nbsp;&nbsp;  to many, many processes including vacancies.&nbsp; Okay. But this is sort of the rate. So you can&nbsp;&nbsp;  think of this as-- Okay. Let's just-- That's the&nbsp; rate of a process rate. The rate of some process.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay. I mean you could think about it as the&nbsp; number of times something happens per second.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's a rate. Right? It doesn't have to be those&nbsp; units, but that's like a rate. Right? How often&nbsp;&nbsp;  does this happen. The rate-- But now so that's&nbsp; dependent on something called the pre-exponential,&nbsp;&nbsp;  that I will talk about. 'Pre-exponential--&nbsp; exponential'. That is a factor that is a constant.  And here we have this exponent-- and this&nbsp; is such a beautiful expression. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;  the average thermal energy. 'average kinetic&nbsp; energy, average thermal energy' Right? It's&nbsp;&nbsp;  taking temperature and it's making an energy out&nbsp; of it. Now remember we've already talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;  this before. That you know you don't get what you&nbsp; get are distributions. So you know this would be T&nbsp;&nbsp;  high-- remember I've drawn this exact thing and&nbsp; this might be T low and this might be-- You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;  this might be the you know the probability of&nbsp; something happening. Probability of occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And then in this case we talked about this&nbsp; as the kinetic energy of the molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's a graph we showed already. But so the--&nbsp; But this RT is an average. But so I just want&nbsp;&nbsp;  to make sure you don't forget. This is a number.&nbsp; This is a number. You've got at 300 degrees, at a&nbsp;&nbsp;  thousand degrees, you calculate a number here.&nbsp; But whenever you're talking about temperature,&nbsp;&nbsp;  you're talking about distributions. There's some&nbsp; average of the distribution but you're always&nbsp;&nbsp;  talking about distributions. That's important for&nbsp; understanding Arrhenius. Okay. Now this thing here&nbsp;&nbsp;  is called the activation energy. Activation&nbsp; energy. And that is the energy that you have&nbsp;&nbsp;  to get over for something to happen. For&nbsp; the thing to happen. Let's take-- I love&nbsp;&nbsp;  this analogy of the bookcase. I'm going to draw&nbsp; that now. So let's suppose that you have energy,&nbsp;&nbsp;  like that. Okay. So maybe this is like potential&nbsp; energy. Yeah, let's go ahead and say potential&nbsp;&nbsp;  energy. Then if I've got a bookcase and it's very&nbsp; very heavy. And I try-- and I want to push it over&nbsp;&nbsp;  on this hinge. So I want to rotate it and push&nbsp; over. Then you could imagine that at some point&nbsp;&nbsp;  it's going to look like this. And then&nbsp; at another point, it's going to look&nbsp;&nbsp;  like this. Right? So this is like step one,&nbsp; and that's step two, and that's step three.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And now I'm pushing this thing over. Well this is&nbsp; the activated state. Why? Because it's where I've&nbsp;&nbsp;  gotten to the highest energy, and that's where&nbsp; this energy graph is important. This energy axis,&nbsp;&nbsp;  this is the activated state of the bookcase.&nbsp; Right? So if I plot the the energies.  Right? You can say one, two, three. You&nbsp; can think about it like that. Right?&nbsp;&nbsp;  I've literally-- So because it's a potential&nbsp; energy, right? So it's like here's the&nbsp;&nbsp;  gravitational pull, here it went up a little bit.&nbsp; Right? So you can think about it just like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And here it came back down. That's why I like&nbsp; this analogy because it really gives you intuitive&nbsp;&nbsp;  feeling for what's happening here. There's a&nbsp; process. The process is pushing the bookcase over.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That bookcase has some energy associated&nbsp; with it. Here and here. Potential energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And it's got some energy I gotta put into&nbsp; it to activate it to go from here to here.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Right? That's why that's called the activation&nbsp; energy. That's what this Ea means for the general&nbsp;&nbsp;  Arrhenius equation. You're pushing the bookcase&nbsp; over. Yeah but how are you going to push it over?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well clearly you're going to run&nbsp; around the room and accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;  knock into it because that's temperature.&nbsp; Maybe that's not a good-- But if you had a&nbsp;&nbsp;  lot of people running around a bookcase maybe&nbsp; once in a while they'd kind of bang into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thermal energy. Right? And then maybe another&nbsp; time, you increase how fast everyone's running,&nbsp;&nbsp;  and you give them more energy. So now not only&nbsp; are they hitting it more frequently but they're&nbsp;&nbsp;  they're actually hitting it with more energy.&nbsp; They're able to give it more energy. Now you make&nbsp;&nbsp;  everyone run really fast. And the chances that&nbsp; this thing goes through that process are higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's what that is. That's a probability,&nbsp; right? This is what this exponential is. That&nbsp;&nbsp;  was the brilliance of what he did right.&nbsp; So this thermal energy is like, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;  it's how much-- It's like a probability but that's&nbsp; why it goes into an exponential. Because when you&nbsp;&nbsp;  increase temperature, again it's not just that&nbsp; you're increasing how much energy over here,&nbsp;&nbsp;  Right? How this is get like kinetic energy of&nbsp; some molecules. Maybe how much energy those&nbsp;&nbsp;  molecules have but you're increasing how many of&nbsp; them are above some threshold. So your chances&nbsp;&nbsp;  go exponentially higher. Well you think if&nbsp; it was harder and harder to push. But this&nbsp;&nbsp;  is going to go the other way too. You could have&nbsp; sometimes somebody might knock it the other way.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It looks kind of hard from this picture.&nbsp; But there's a chance. It's just that&nbsp;&nbsp;  the activation energy going this way, right?&nbsp; Going this way, the activation energy is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Ea' and going this way the activation&nbsp; energy would be here. So this would be 'Ea'&nbsp;&nbsp;  for, let's see, three to one. And this&nbsp; would be 'Ea' for one to three. Now again,&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am giving you the general Arrhenius. We will&nbsp; be coming back to this when we do reaction rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We will be coming back to this picture, and we&nbsp; will be talking about reactions, and then we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;  be using that, and going to equilibrium. Today,&nbsp; I want to give you a sense for what Arrhenius is&nbsp;&nbsp;  because this is where the equation comes from. And&nbsp; because if you think about now defect formation.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Defect formation is an activated-- it's a&nbsp; thermally activated process. But that's exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;  the point. So that's why if we write this down--&nbsp; I've said this now multiple times the vacancy...  'vacany'. No. Vacancy is&nbsp; always present. Always present!  Why? Because it's thermally activated. So unless&nbsp; I can get to T equals zero-- thermally activated.  There's always a chance that I&nbsp; push a vacancy into the material.&nbsp;&nbsp;  There's also always a chance&nbsp; that the vacancy gets pushed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So those are happening because of temperature.&nbsp; You can think about that. It kind of makes sense,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? Atoms are moving. Those are the people--&nbsp; right-- there's the people in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And now all of a sudden, something happens&nbsp; somewhere that allows an atom to come out.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We'll talk about that in a second. And create&nbsp; a vacancy. Now there's a chance that it can go&nbsp;&nbsp;  back too, right? And so there's at some point&nbsp; there's an equilibrium concentration. Both of&nbsp;&nbsp;  those are thermally activated processes that have&nbsp; an Arrhenius like behavior. And so you get to...  the very nice expression for concentration.&nbsp; So you can get-- can get? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;  why not-- get concentration. So&nbsp; the concentration at equilibrium.  Since vacancy formation is thermally activated&nbsp; and it's thermally deactivated. There's some--&nbsp;&nbsp;  you know, you can say well when it's activated&nbsp; and deactivated in the same rates you're in&nbsp;&nbsp;  equilibrium. That's how you get a concentration.&nbsp; And I don't need you to know the math&nbsp;&nbsp;  but I need-- This is where it comes from. The&nbsp; number of vacancies divided by the total number&nbsp;&nbsp;  of sites is equal to e to the minus E vacancy--&nbsp; I will talk about this-- vacancy divided by,&nbsp;&nbsp;  let's use RT still. RT. Now here's the thing&nbsp; about RT. Let's write this down because this&nbsp;&nbsp;  is really important, right? If-- we talked about&nbsp; this before-- if I'm using RT then it's per mole.  Per mole use RT. This is the ideal&nbsp; gas constant, right? That's not just&nbsp;&nbsp;  used for ideal gases. This is used for a&nbsp; lot of things. That's the gas constant.  Gas constant. That's equal to-- let's see if i&nbsp; have down here-- 8.314 joules per mole Kelvin.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So you see if I'm working in per mole, then I use&nbsp; R. This is-- the energy unit the-- those energy&nbsp;&nbsp;  units have to be the same. They got to cancel. So&nbsp; if my activation energy is in per mole, fine, use&nbsp;&nbsp;  the gas constant. If the activation energy is in&nbsp; per atom then we just use the Boltzmann constant:&nbsp;&nbsp;  kBT. Where the Boltzmann constant&nbsp; is something we have seen,&nbsp;&nbsp;  it is equal to the ideal gas constant divided by&nbsp; Avogadro's number. Remember that Avogadro's number&nbsp;&nbsp;  goes in and out atomic macroscopic worlds&nbsp; so R and kB same thing. Okay. One thing--&nbsp;&nbsp;  notice that's per Kelvin. Whenever you have&nbsp; equations like this that come from thermodynamics,&nbsp;&nbsp;  which is where these things come from.&nbsp; There is only one temperature unit. There&nbsp;&nbsp;  is no other. And it is Kelvin. You have to be&nbsp; aware of that. If you see something in Celsius,&nbsp;&nbsp;  it's not going to work. It's got to be Kelvin.&nbsp; All of these equations have to use Kelvin. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So that now-- you can see at any&nbsp; time, you know, any time you see  an equation with an exponential.&nbsp; What's the first thing you want to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;  I mean it's like an-- it's almost like an&nbsp; instinctual reaction. You see an exponential. Take&nbsp;&nbsp;  a log. Don't say anything until you take a log.&nbsp; Right? So that's an-- so that-- so we're talking&nbsp;&nbsp;  about energy of the vacancy in a minute. But if&nbsp; you take a log of this. Then you get that the log&nbsp;&nbsp;  of what '|n(Nv)'. Well I'll talk&nbsp; about that. Equals log of N.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let's do it this way. Minus&nbsp; log of n equals E vacancy.  Okay. Divided by RT. That's just taking an&nbsp; exponential, a logarithm of this equation. And&nbsp;&nbsp;  now I can talk about these Nv and N. So Nv is--&nbsp; this is literally a concentration. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp;  concentration of vacancies that are forming in my&nbsp; crystal. Why did i get this expression and notice&nbsp;&nbsp;  the constant cancelled. This pre-exponential&nbsp; factor cancelled. It canceled because&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm taking a concentration. I'm looking at the&nbsp; rate going one way and the rate going the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And I get to take a ratio of those. That leads&nbsp; me to this expression. That's how you get from&nbsp;&nbsp;  Arrhenius rates to some concentration. Okay. But&nbsp; you still-- but notice it's still-- we call this&nbsp;&nbsp;  Arrhenius-like because it's still an exponential&nbsp; dependence. It's not a rate, it's a concentration.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's okay. It's a concentration in equilibrium.&nbsp; So this would be like the number of vacancies,&nbsp;&nbsp;  number of vacancies. And this one here&nbsp; 'n' would be like the number of sites,&nbsp;&nbsp;  number of lattice sites. So it's like you&nbsp; know concentration. Lattice sites. Right?  And what is this? This is exactly here, here we&nbsp; go. I have my crystal. Okay. Here's my crystal and&nbsp;&nbsp;  here it is... I think I'll&nbsp; stop here. And now I did this.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We're going to go graphical and this and this.  That energy is literally the energy difference.&nbsp; It's literally the energy difference between&nbsp;&nbsp;  having a vacancy and not having&nbsp; a vacancy. How much energy--&nbsp;&nbsp;  Question? [STUDENT:] Isn't there supposed to&nbsp; be a negative sign in front of the E vacancy?  [PROFESSOR:] Yes there is. Oh yes there&nbsp; is. Yes there is. Thank you very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes. So that's-- Okay. So now the energy&nbsp; difference between having a vacancy and not,&nbsp;&nbsp;  is the vacancy formation energy. E vacancy. Now&nbsp; sometimes, and this is unfortunate, but sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;  you will see the vacancy formation energy written&nbsp; as the activation energy. That's fine. I mean it&nbsp;&nbsp;  just it's written that way to get across the&nbsp; point that it's an Arrhenius-like behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But actually the act-- but&nbsp; if you're clear about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And that's why I want to go through the bookcase&nbsp; example, right? The formation energy which is this&nbsp;&nbsp;  energy of the vacancy forming is the difference&nbsp; between here and here. The activation energy&nbsp;&nbsp;  is this hill that you got to get over to go back&nbsp; and forth. Okay? So the formation energy between&nbsp;&nbsp;  having a vacancy and not is what goes into our our&nbsp; equation. Alright. Now we're going to use this.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So we will see how this works in just a few&nbsp; minutes. But again there are so many processes&nbsp;&nbsp;  that are thermally activated. There are so many&nbsp; processes that have Arrhenius-like behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That are Arrhenius-like. And if you go to&nbsp; Dartmouth then they'll give you goodie bags&nbsp;&nbsp;  with live crickets. And actually I really&nbsp; hope not. But this is one of the labs that&nbsp;&nbsp;  they have where they take crickets and they&nbsp; measure the number of times a cricket chirps.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And they're like, well okay. Let's measure the&nbsp; cricket chirp over 13 seconds. We're gonna cool&nbsp;&nbsp;  them down, hopefully not too cold, and then we're&nbsp; going to heat them up, hopefully not too hot.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Because crickets are nice, right? And so&nbsp; then-- and they ca-- but look at that. And&nbsp;&nbsp;  they count it. And then what do they do? Well they&nbsp; didn't know about Arrhenius yet until somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;  from MIT went and visited. So the first thing&nbsp; they did is they plotted the data. Look at that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Chirps per 13 seconds plotted. And they're all&nbsp; sitting there trying to fit a straight line to&nbsp;&nbsp;  it. And then someone from this class is up&nbsp; there visiting. They're like, you know what&nbsp;&nbsp;  i think, this looks like a thermally activated&nbsp; process. So i think it's probably exponential.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And then they fit this nice exponential and&nbsp; it fits the the cricket tripping beautifully.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And you can go even further because you see&nbsp; if you got this far. Well now you see this&nbsp;&nbsp;  is a line. This is a line and we're going to do&nbsp; that a lot when we go into reaction kinetics.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you have a exponential and you take a log,&nbsp; that's a line versus 1 over T. Right? That's a&nbsp;&nbsp;  line versus 1 over T. And so that's another way&nbsp; you could look at data. They didn't do it there.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But, you know, you could plot for example--&nbsp; you could plot 1 over T versus the log of&nbsp;&nbsp;  the number of vacancies. But the lattice-- the&nbsp; number of vacancies is what we want. That ratio&nbsp;&nbsp;  is the concentration. That concentration&nbsp; is in equilibrium at some temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay. The lattice-- the number of lattice sites&nbsp; is simply how many lattice sites you have,&nbsp;&nbsp;  in whatever volume you have, for whatever crystal&nbsp; structure you have, for whatever element you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We'll see that in a few examples. So that's just&nbsp; a concert-- it's the number of sites you have in&nbsp;&nbsp;  the chunk of material. And then instead of-- The&nbsp; question this equation tells you the answer to,&nbsp;&nbsp;  is how many of those have a vacancy?&nbsp; Because it's a thermally activated process.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And if you plot that log in Nv versus&nbsp; temperature you get this really nice&nbsp;&nbsp;  linear line. And the slope of that&nbsp; line is equal to minus E vacancy  divided by R or it could be kB. R.&nbsp; Let's write this again per mole.  Or it could be kB if it's&nbsp; per atom. You will see both.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You will see both. And this&nbsp; intercept-- intercept--  is equal to the-- let's see-- the intercept&nbsp; is equal-- what do i have here? The&nbsp;&nbsp;  log of n. Did i write it right? Log of n.  Okay. Alright.  Now, okay. Oh yeah. What else can you&nbsp; do? Well before we go on to the defects,&nbsp;&nbsp;  this explains the doping. I kept calling&nbsp; the doping in semiconductors a thermally&nbsp;&nbsp;  activated process. But look at what happens.&nbsp; This is the carrier concentration in that&nbsp;&nbsp;  conduction band. The thing you've&nbsp; been you've been learning about,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? And thinking about. But look at it&nbsp; now versus temperature. It's a straight line.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's a straight line. This is-- this&nbsp; is experimentally what you observe.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the reason is because it's a thermally&nbsp; activated process. And in fact, in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;  what is the activation energy? Right? The&nbsp; activation energy for getting an electron into&nbsp;&nbsp;  the conduction band is the gap. Right? And so now&nbsp; you say germanium has a smaller gap than silicon,&nbsp;&nbsp;  which has a smaller gap than gallium arsenide.&nbsp; The slopes are different. The slopes are different&nbsp;&nbsp;  because the energy that it takes in that activated&nbsp; process is the gap. That's why the slopes are&nbsp;&nbsp;  different. Right? Okay. Alright. Now on to--&nbsp; oh no i didn't-- I did want to mention this&nbsp;&nbsp;  because it's so cool. Where are these vacancies&nbsp; going? Did you actually just take an atom from&nbsp;&nbsp;  the middle of a crystal and remove it? No.&nbsp; Because that would cost way too much energy,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? And so instead they have&nbsp; to-- you call out to the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's a call out to the surface. Or,&nbsp; you know, maybe the surface calls in.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It all has to happen on the surface. So what&nbsp; ends up happening is a surface atom may go away&nbsp;&nbsp;  and then another one may take its place, right?&nbsp; And then the next one, and then the next one,&nbsp;&nbsp;  and that's literally how you can rip&nbsp; an atom out from somewhere inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But by the same-- that's literally pushing the&nbsp; bookcase over. Right? And now you can push it&nbsp;&nbsp;  the other way and the surface atom could go&nbsp; in to the crystal so that some atom inside is&nbsp;&nbsp;  able to fill a vacancy. It all comes to&nbsp; the surface. This is a beautiful paper,&nbsp;&nbsp;  where they're showing how you get these rings.&nbsp; This was published almost 20 years ago now. But&nbsp;&nbsp;  how-- they're studying how do vacancies actually&nbsp; pull atoms from the surface specifically.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And what they did is they change the temperature&nbsp; and they see islands growing and shrinking. Where&nbsp;&nbsp;  are those islands going and where are they coming&nbsp; from? Vacancies. It's all about the vacancies,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? And one of the things I loved about&nbsp; this, is this is the abstract of this paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Look at this. Here we show the vacancy generation&nbsp; and annihilation, right? Both ways on the 1-1-0&nbsp;&nbsp;  surface of an ordered nickel aluminum&nbsp; inter-metallic alloy. Oh, I love reading&nbsp;&nbsp;  that because you guys all are experts in this&nbsp; now. You know what that means. You know what that&nbsp;&nbsp;  means. Where do vacancies come from? Okay. And&nbsp; now we got to make vacancies. Right? And so this&nbsp;&nbsp;  is the kind of problem you might get. How many&nbsp; vacancies are in a centimeter cubed of copper?&nbsp;&nbsp;  How many vacancies are in a centimeter cubed&nbsp; of copper? Well, now you know how to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You're just going to apply this Arrhenius-like&nbsp; behavior. You're going to apply this equation to&nbsp;&nbsp;  figure that out. And i won't go through&nbsp; all the math but i do want to just&nbsp;&nbsp;  give you a sense of the types of questions&nbsp; that you can now answer; that you know  how to think about vacancy formation.&nbsp; So for example, in this one you've got&nbsp;&nbsp;  step one. Step one: you would find N.  Step one: you'd find N. How many sites do I&nbsp; have? Because remember this equation is about&nbsp;&nbsp;  a concentration between the number of vacancies&nbsp; and the number of available sites for vacancies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And so step one-- well-- so step one you'd say N&nbsp; equals Avogadro's number times 8.4 grams per mole.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Right? Divided by all this-- is such old-school&nbsp; stuff right now, right? Grams per mole. Then you&nbsp;&nbsp;  look that up in the periodic table and it's 8&nbsp; times 10 to the 22nd sites per centimeter cubed.  Why am I using centimeter cubed? Well because&nbsp; that's what i was given the density in. So I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;  just leaving it in those units for now.&nbsp; Right? And then step two you can find Nv.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So now we can apply our our equation.&nbsp; Nv equals N, I won't repeat it, times&nbsp;&nbsp;  e. Now I've got my kB instead of R. So it's 9.9&nbsp; electron volts divided by and then this is kBT.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now I get-- so I'm given that it's a thousand--&nbsp; wait a second. What's the term, oh a thousand&nbsp;&nbsp;  degrees. So do I put T equals a thousand. No!&nbsp; No! You never use-- you only use Kelvin. 1273,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? T is always in Kelvin&nbsp; for any of these thermodynamic&nbsp;&nbsp;  equations. And I won't go through the math but&nbsp; it goes something like 2.2 times 10 to the 19th  vacancies. I'll write the units here just for&nbsp; completeness. Vacancies per centimeter cubed.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now that seems like a lot but it's actually&nbsp; not. You say it's like one in a thousand or&nbsp;&nbsp;  one in ten thousand atoms are missing and I'm at&nbsp; a really high temperature. If I were at-- then&nbsp;&nbsp;  this is the power of what Arrhenius gave us.&nbsp; If-- Because it's exponential. It's all about&nbsp;&nbsp;  probabilities and sampling and how many times&nbsp; did i bump into that bookcase. If I'm down at&nbsp;&nbsp;  room temperature I've got so much less energy,&nbsp; and so many more chances-- so many fewer chances&nbsp;&nbsp;  to deliver that energy. Right? Where the surface&nbsp; is taking atoms in and out to create vacancies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That at room temperature the number of vacancies&nbsp; is 10 to the seventh instead of 10 to the 19th.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Right? So that's the power of that exponential.&nbsp; That's the power of the exponential. You might&nbsp;&nbsp;  also be asked questions like this one. Right? So&nbsp; --oh no like-- let me do this one. Then I'll talk&nbsp;&nbsp;  about your goodie bag. Where instead of now--&nbsp; Okay. What-- Example two. What is the vacancy&nbsp;&nbsp;  formation energy in aluminum? And now notice,&nbsp; instead of giving you the vacancy formation energy&nbsp;&nbsp;  per atom, I'm giving you other stuff. I'm&nbsp; actually giving you how many vacancies you got,&nbsp;&nbsp;  at some temperature. Well that's-- This just going&nbsp; in a different direction but it's using the same&nbsp;&nbsp;  math. So you can go in different ways, arrive at&nbsp; the same kinds of equations, and get all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;  things, and I won't go through the details.&nbsp; But in this case you get that Ea equals minus&nbsp;&nbsp;  kBT. I'm using kB because look at that...&nbsp; the formation energy I'm asking is what is&nbsp;&nbsp;  the vacancy formation energy-- Okay, well actually&nbsp; look at that. No, I just want to do it per atom.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It didn't say per atom but if I wanted to do a per&nbsp; atom, I'd use kBT times log Nv over N. And so you&nbsp;&nbsp;  see 0.75 eV per atom. Now what's interesting,&nbsp; copper was-- copper was 0.9, aluminum .75.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You're going to have a lot more vacancies&nbsp; because it's exponential. This seems like-- 0.9,&nbsp;&nbsp;  .75 is kind of the same. No. It's going into an&nbsp; exponential, so it has a really big difference&nbsp;&nbsp;  on how many vacancies you have at any given&nbsp; temperature. Aluminum is going to have a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;  more because it's easier to get them in there.&nbsp; Right? Notice I did the thing that I said other&nbsp;&nbsp;  people do and I don't really like. That's the&nbsp; energy of the vacancy. The vacancy formation.  People call it activation&nbsp; energy all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay. Now this is your goodie bag.&nbsp; Now why am I giving to you? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;  first of all, this is the most sophisticated&nbsp; vacancy generation machine you'll ever find.&nbsp;&nbsp;  There are exactly 500 beads in this. Exactly.&nbsp; There are not 501. There are not 499. And you know&nbsp;&nbsp;  why? Because Laura has spent 7,000 hours counting&nbsp; beads in every single one of these. So you have&nbsp;&nbsp;  exactly the right number. Then there's precision&nbsp; tape and polycarbonate films maybe. And what you&nbsp;&nbsp;  guys can do is build your own crystal. It's a 2d&nbsp; crystal. Here's what's so cool about this. Try to&nbsp;&nbsp;  get those vacancies out. Look at this! Dude-- None&nbsp; of you can see what I'm talking about. [LAUGHTER]  There's a big vacancy there, I've literally&nbsp; made this right in front of me. This is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And now I'm gonna say--&nbsp; okay, I'll use temperature.  There's so many more. There's so many more because&nbsp; I use temperature. This is temperature. You are&nbsp;&nbsp;  temperature. And you can run around, and you can&nbsp; shake it, and all you bring it to the dance floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;  and on. Then you're like how can I get-- Whoa,&nbsp; wait a second. I'll just quietly go down in&nbsp;&nbsp;  temperature and I'll get rid of them. Yeah,&nbsp; tell that to your friends down the street. See&nbsp;&nbsp;  how long they go until they stop trying because&nbsp; you guys know not to try because you'll never get&nbsp;&nbsp;  rid of them. You'll never get rid of them. You'll&nbsp; always have vacancies and this is proof that you&nbsp;&nbsp;  will always have vacancies. You can try to tap it&nbsp; like that. See if you can get rid of the defects.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You can't. Luckily that's a good thing because&nbsp; defects are what make everything interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Everything. This is your goodie bag. So you&nbsp; can touch and feel-- Oh, but we got to cover&nbsp;&nbsp;  the other case. Because-- See I could have had&nbsp; not just a metal, where every atom is the same,&nbsp;&nbsp;  but i could have had an ionic solid. You can&nbsp; make point defects in ionic solids as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Right? So yeah. So if I had a defect in an ionic&nbsp; solid-- well now you got to consider the charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I can't just keep pulling-- If this is sodium&nbsp; chloride, I can't just keep pulling out&nbsp;&nbsp;  like one type of atom. If I take a sodium&nbsp; atom out. Like imagine that's a plus,&nbsp;&nbsp;  minus, plus, minus. Right? The size-- if I take a&nbsp; sodium atom out then it becomes charged. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;  remember the ionic bond is one of them, grabbed&nbsp; it and it has it. And so if I take one out,&nbsp;&nbsp;  I've charged the crystal. You can't do that. It&nbsp; won't let you. So if I take a sodium atom out,&nbsp;&nbsp;  a chlorine is going to come too. It's got to&nbsp; come too. You got to keep it charged neutral,&nbsp;&nbsp;  if it starts charging neutral. So these&nbsp; have special names because of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And there are two types of defects in ionic&nbsp; point defects. We're still with point defects.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Local disruption in the regularity. One is called&nbsp; the shocky defect, right? So in the shocky defect  you got both an anion and a cation are removed.&nbsp; Cation. Now here's the thing- I should have put&nbsp;&nbsp;  's' because you may need to take&nbsp; more than one out. Alright? Removed--&nbsp;&nbsp;  and because you got to ensure--  ensure charge neutrality. Charge neutrality. So&nbsp; like you know-- If I had so inquiry that's fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But what if I had you know something else.&nbsp; What if I had instead of sodium chloride.&nbsp;&nbsp;  What if I had like calcium chloride. So now what&nbsp; if I had calcium chloride. Well that looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;  that. Because calcium goes to two plus. We&nbsp; know this. Right? But chlorine is only minus&nbsp;&nbsp;  one so that ionic crystal is different. And&nbsp; what it means is that if I remove-- if I remove  a calcium it's going to come out&nbsp; as Ca2 plus but that means i need  to remove two Cl minus atoms.  That's the thing about shocking defects. You&nbsp; got to keep the charge balanced. So now you--&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's not just a one for one. This could actually&nbsp; be a way to take atoms out. Or if I want to take&nbsp;&nbsp;  chlorine out of this, we'll take some calcium out.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Chlorine will come out too. Right?&nbsp; Could be a way to engineer it.  So that's a that's a shocking defect. But&nbsp; the simpler thing that could have happened&nbsp;&nbsp;  is just that one of these atoms kind of moved&nbsp; over. So now I didn't remove it from the crystal&nbsp;&nbsp;  but it just kind of wandered over into some site.&nbsp; So like you know... here's BCC. I can have like&nbsp;&nbsp;  an atom-- so this doesn't look like an ionic solid&nbsp; but suppose-- it doesn't matter. I could have an&nbsp;&nbsp;  atom leave a site and go-- Notice that there&nbsp; are these voids, right? They're these spaces in&nbsp;&nbsp;  between other atoms. Well those spaces are places&nbsp; where atoms can go. They're not-- It's not part&nbsp;&nbsp;  of the regular lattice but it's just-- it's like&nbsp; a hole, right? Remember the packing fractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We never got above about three quarters. We&nbsp; never got about three-- that means there's&nbsp;&nbsp;  still a bunch of volume in there that's free&nbsp; volume. Right? Where is it? Well this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;  defect will find it. Right? So you could have&nbsp; the smaller ion migrate over, create a vacancy,&nbsp;&nbsp;  and it's going to find a place where it likes&nbsp; to go. Ah. Okay. Yeah, we'll do this. And so--  so that's called a Frenkel defect.  So Frenkel defect is the other kind of special&nbsp; name we give to a vacancy in an ionic solid, and&nbsp;&nbsp;  it's where one ion-- right-- anion&nbsp; or cation. Anion or cation. Moves  to some open space. Open space in the lattice.&nbsp; And you can already kind of feel where this&nbsp;&nbsp;  might be kind of common. It might be common in&nbsp; situations where you've got a big size difference,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? So like the silver halides are a&nbsp; good example. Like silver chloride, silver&nbsp;&nbsp;  bromide, silver iodide. Those&nbsp; are all good examples because&nbsp;&nbsp;  what happens there is this ionic structure has&nbsp; a very big mismatch between the atom sizes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And so you can see. Let's blow up a picture of&nbsp; this is silver iodide, a cartoon. Look at that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So those are the silver atoms and what you see&nbsp; is because there's such a big difference in size,&nbsp;&nbsp;  you're going to have these pretty big voids.&nbsp; And one of the atoms is small enough that it&nbsp;&nbsp;  actually doesn't mind-- it's actually pretty&nbsp; easy to move it. Ah now, if you think about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well if you have enough vacancies in there, then&nbsp; maybe those ions can actually move really freely.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Because they're so small and the voids&nbsp; are all kind of nearby. And you actually&nbsp;&nbsp;  can get a conductor, a good conductor, this&nbsp; way. You're creating vacancies on purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;  so that one of the ions can move around. The&nbsp; smaller one, right? That's what we do. We make&nbsp;&nbsp;  these solid-state ionic conductors. You need&nbsp; the vacancies. You need the vacancies. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now, I told you that we got this map here. We've&nbsp; talked about literally just one. Luckily I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;  have nearly the same amount of material to talk&nbsp; about these others. The vacancy is clearly the one&nbsp;&nbsp;  that I'm very interested in. The substi-- the&nbsp; self-interstitial is actually pretty easy to&nbsp;&nbsp;  understand. The self-interstitial is actually&nbsp; pretty easy to understand because it simply&nbsp;&nbsp;  doesn't really happen much. And the reason is, if&nbsp; you look at this. Here's a picture of is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;  what i drew on the board, right? But now I've&nbsp; put-- so these are-- this is not a vacancy,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? This is a kind of point defect but it's&nbsp; not a vacancy. I've actually added an atom into&nbsp;&nbsp;  the lattice and I've squeezed it in between all&nbsp; the others. You can just feel how much energy,&nbsp;&nbsp;  how much strain, those other atoms are gonna&nbsp; have to make and how much energy that's going&nbsp;&nbsp;  to cost. Those are high energy defect. So&nbsp; a self-interstitial-- a self-interstitial--&nbsp;&nbsp;  self just means it's the same atom as the rest of&nbsp; them, is very infrequent. Is very infrequent. The&nbsp;&nbsp;  self-interstitial-- let's see-- I'll just use this&nbsp; one again. The self-interstitial has an energy of&nbsp;&nbsp;  formation of something like you know five electron&nbsp; volts. And you think but-- five electron volts.  Self-interstitial. Self-interstitial.  It went in between, so it's not substitutional&nbsp;&nbsp;  it's interstitial and itself because it's the&nbsp; same atom type. The energy energy of formation  is 5ev. I think 5ev doesn't even sound that much&nbsp; higher than like the one ev you had for copper,&nbsp;&nbsp;  right? 0.9 ev. But it goes into the exponential,&nbsp; right? So it's like one per centimeter cubed.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Literally. You get like one of these happening&nbsp; per centimeter cubed instead of 10 to the 20th,&nbsp;&nbsp;  or 10 to the 10th, or you know many many orders&nbsp; of magnitude higher. So the self-interstitial is&nbsp;&nbsp;  actually not very interesting. It's actually&nbsp; not very interesting. Now because we have&nbsp;&nbsp;  like half a minute left, I'm not gonna&nbsp; talk about these. We'll have a very brief&nbsp;&nbsp;  discussion about these last two types of&nbsp; point defects and then we're gonna make&nbsp;&nbsp;  line defects on Wednesday. And my why this&nbsp; matters, I'll give you on Wednesday for this.
