 This week, we will use the concept of momentum  to analyze some more advanced situations.  Namely, systems in which there is a continuous flow of mass  rather than just the motion of discrete objects.  The classic example of this is the thrust  due to exhaust from a rocket engine.  Once again, we will appeal to a differential analysis  technique.  Breaking the flow down into a large number of small elements,  analyzing one of the elements in detail, and then generalizing.  This is an important example of a situation where  the point mass form of Newton's Second Law of Motion-- f equals  ma-- is inadequate, and one must instead  use the more general form of the law-- f  equals dpdt-- or the force is equal to the time  derivative of the momentum.
