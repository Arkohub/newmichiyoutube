ANA BELL: So I'm creating a variable called pset_time  and I'm assigning it to be the value 15.  I'm creating a variable named sleep_time.  I'm assigning it to be the value 8.  I'm going to print the value of this expression here.  And the expression is a conditional that says,  is sleep_time greater than pset_time?  So in Python, you're just going to replace these variables  with their values.  So is 8 greater than 15?  And that's false, so perfect.  And then one operation on Booleans derive as true.  Drink is false.  I'm using the AND operator to figure out  if I should drink and derive, and I'm  going to print out false.  So, perfect, people are getting it.  Great job, guys.
