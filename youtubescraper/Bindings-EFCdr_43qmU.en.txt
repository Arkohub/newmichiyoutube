So we have 46 for USA gold, 27 for UK gold,  1 for Romanian gold.  We make this variable, here, Total Gold,  to be the sum of those three which I believe is 74.  Then we're going to print total gold.  OK?  Then we're going to increase the value for Romanian gold  and we're going to print it again.  So as always, you can just copy this, pop it into Python,  and run it to test yourself, but you should do it just  in your mind first.  So notice it print 74 in 74, and that's  because we never told the program  to calculate the new total.  So we only calculated the total, way up here on line 5.  If we calculated the total again down here,  then it would be 74.75 So let's look at the answers,  hopefully you guys got that.  Perfect, majority are good to go.  If you didn't get that please try to review it,  review why it didn't work.
